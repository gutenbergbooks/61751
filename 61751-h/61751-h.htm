  <p class="noindent">‘<span class="smcap">I wanted</span> a book on the Sword, not a treatise on Carte and Tierce,’
    said the Publisher, when, some years ago, my earliest manuscript was
    sent to him.</p>

  <p>It struck me then and there that the Publisher was right. Consequently
    the volume was re-written after a more general and less professional
    fashion.</p>

  <p>I have only one wish that reader and reviewer can grant: namely, a fair
    field and no favour for certain ‘advanced views’ of Egyptology. It
    is my conviction that this study, still in its infancy, will greatly
    modify almost all our preconceived views of archæological history.</p>

    <h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The history of the Sword</span>
    is the history of humanity. The ‘White Arm’
    means something more than the ‘oldest, the most universal, the most
    varied of weapons, the only one which has lived through all time.’</p>

  <p>He, she, or it—for the gender of the Sword varies—has been worshipped
    with priestly sacrifices as a present god. Hebrew revelation represents
    the sharp and two-edged Sword going out of the mouth of the King of
    Kings, and Lord of Lords. We read of a ‘Sword of God, a holy Sword,’
    the ‘Sword of the Lord and of Gideon’; and ‘I came not to send peace
    but a Sword,’ meaning the warfare and martyrdom of man.</p>

  <p>On a lower plane the Sword became the invention and the favourite arm
    of the gods and the demi-gods: a gift of magic, one of the treasures
    sent down from Heaven, which made Mulciber (‘Malik Kabír,’ the great
    king) divine, and Voelunder, Quida, Galant, or Wayland Smith a hero.
    It was consecrated to the deities, and was stored in the Temple and in
    the Church. It was the ‘key of heaven and hell’: the saying is, ‘If
    there were no Sword, there would be no law of Mohammed’; and the Moslem
    brave’s highest title was ‘Sayf Ullah’—Sword of Allah.</p>

  <p>Uniformly and persistently personal, the Sword became no longer an
    abstraction but a Personage, endowed with human as well as superhuman
    qualities. He was a sentient being who spoke, and sang, and joyed, and
    grieved. Identified with his wearer he was an object of affection, and
    was pompously named as a well-beloved son and heir. To surrender the
    Sword was submission; to break the Sword was degradation. To kiss the
    Sword was, and in places still is, the highest form of oath and homage.</p>

  <p class="noindent">The Sword killed and cured; the hero when hopeless fell upon his Sword;
    and the heroine, like Lucretia and Calphurnia, used the blade standing.
    The Sword<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xii">xii</a></span> cut the Gordian knot of every difficulty. The Sword was the
    symbol of justice and of martyrdom, and accompanied the wearer to the
    tomb as well as to the feast and the fight. ‘Lay on my coffin a Sword,’
    said dying Heinrich Heine, ‘for I have warred doughtily to win freedom
    for mankind.’</p>

  <p>From days immemorial the Queen of Weapons, a creator as well as a
    destroyer, ‘carved out history, formed the nations, and shaped the
    world.’ She decided the Alexandrine and the Cæsarian victories which
    opened new prospects to human ken. She diffused everywhere the bright
    lights and splendid benefits of war and conquest, whose functions are
    all important in the formative and progressive processes. It is no
    paradox to assert <i lang="fr">La guerre a enfanté le droit</i>: without War there
    would be no Right. The cost of life, says Emerson, the dreary havoc of
    comfort and time, are overpaid by the vistas it opens of Eternal Law
    reconstructing and uplifting society; it breaks up the old horizon, and
    we see through the rifts a wider view.</p>

  <p>War, again, benefits society by raising its tone above the ineffable
    littleness and meanness which characterise the every-day life of the
    many. In the presence of the Great Destroyer, petty feuds and miserable
    envy, hatred, and malice stand hushed and awe-struck. Very hollow in
    these days sounds Voltaire’s banter on War when he says that a king
    picks up a parcel of men who have nothing to do, dresses them in blue
    cloth at two shillings a yard, binds their hats with coarse white
    worsted, turns them to the right and left, and marches them away to
    glory.</p>

  <p>The Sword and only the Sword raised the worthier race to power upon
    the ruins of impotent savagery; and she carried in her train, from
    time immemorial, throughout the civilised world, Asiatic Africa,
    Asia, and Europe, the arts and the sciences which humanise mankind.
    In fact, whatever apparent evil the Sword may have done, she worked
    for the highest ultimate good. With the Arabs the Sword was a type of
    individuality. Thus Shanfara, the fleet-foot, sings in his <cite>Lamiyyah</cite>,
    (L-poem):—</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">

  <p class="noindent">Zayd bin Ali boasts, like El-Mutanabbi:—</p>

  </div>

  <p class="noindent">And Ziyád El-Ajam thus writes the epitaph of El-Mughayrah: ‘So died he,
    after having sought death between the spear-point and the Sword-edge.’</p>

  <p>This ‘Pundonor’ presently extended westward. During the knightly ages
    the ‘good Sword’ of the Paladin and the Chevalier embodied a new
    faith—the Religion of Honour, the first step towards the religion of
    humanity. These men once more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiii">xiii</a></span>
    taught the sublime truth, the splendid
    doctrine known to the Stoics and the Pharisees, but unaccountably
    neglected in later creeds:—</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">Do good, for Good is good to do.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">Their recklessness of all consequences soared worlds-high above the
    various egotistic systems which bribe man to do good for a personal and
    private consideration, to win the world, or to save his soul. Hence
    Aristotle blamed his contemporaries, the Spartans: ‘They are indeed
    good men, but they have not the supreme consummate excellence of loving
    all things worthy, decent and laudable, purely as such and for their
    own sakes; nor of practising virtue for no other motive but the sole
    love of her own innate beauty.’ The ‘everlasting Law of Honour binding
    on all and peculiar to each,’ would have thoroughly satisfied the
    Stagirite’s highest aspirations.</p>

  <p>In knightly hands the Sword acknowledged no Fate but that of freedom
    and free-will; and it bred the very spirit of chivalry, a keen personal
    sentiment of self-respect, of dignity, and of loyalty, with the noble
    desire to protect weakness against the abuse of strength. The knightly
    Sword was ever the representative idea, the present and eternal symbol
    of all that man most prized—courage and freedom. The names describe
    her quality: she is Joyeuse, and La Tisona; he is Zú ’l-Fikár (sire of
    splitting) and Quersteinbeis, biter of the mill-stone. The weapon was
    everywhere held to be the best friend of bravery, and the worst foe
    of perfidy; the companion of authority, and the token of commandment;
    the outward and visible sign of force and fidelity, of conquest and
    dominion, of all that Humanity wants to have and wants to be.</p>

  <p>The Sword was carried by and before kings; and the brand, not the
    sceptre, noted their seals of state. As the firm friend of the
    crown and of the ermine robe, it became the second fountain of
    honour. Amongst the ancient Germans even the judges sat armed on the
    judgment-seat; and at marriages it represented the bridegroom in his
    absence. Noble and ennobling, its touch upon the shoulder conferred the
    prize of knighthood. As ‘bakhshish’ it was, and still is, the highest
    testimony to the soldier’s character; a proof that he is ‘brave as
    his sword-blade.’ Its presence was a moral lesson; unlike the Greeks,
    the Romans, and the Hebrews, Western and Southern Europe, during its
    chivalrous ages, appeared nowhere and on no occasion without the Sword.
    It was ever ready to leap from its sheath in the cause of weakness and
    at the call of Honour. Hence, with its arrogant individuality, the
    Sword still remained the ‘all-sufficient type and token of the higher
    sentiments and the higher tendencies of human nature.’</p>

  <p>In society the position of the Sword was remarkable. ‘Its aspect was
    brilliant; its manners were courtly; its habits were punctilious, and
    its connections were patrician.’ Its very vices were glittering; for
    most of them were the abuses which
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiv">xiv</a></span> could not but accompany its uses.
    It bore itself haughtily as a victor, an arbitrator; and necessarily
    there were times when its superlative qualities showed corresponding
    defects. Handled by the vile it too often became, in the ‘syllogism of
    violence,’ an incubus, a blusterer, a bully, a tyrant, a murderer, an
    assassin, in fact ‘death’s stamp’; and under such conditions it was a
    ‘corruption of the best.’ But its lapses were individual and transient;
    its benefits to Humanity were general and ever-enduring.</p>

  <p>The highest period of the Sword was the early sixteenth century, that
    mighty landmark separating the dark Past from the brilliant Present
    of Europe. The sudden awaking and excitement of man’s mind, produced
    by the revival of learning and the marriage-union of the West with
    the East; by the discovering of a new hemisphere, the doubling of the
    world; by the so-called Reformation, a northern protest against the
    slavery of the soul; by the wide spread of the printing-press, which
    meant knowledge; and, simultaneously, by the illumination of that
    electric spark generated from the contact of human thought, suddenly
    changed the status of the Sword. It was no longer an assailant, a
    slaughterer: it became a defender, a preserver. It learned to be shield
    as well as Sword. And now arose swordsmanship proper, when the ‘Art of
    Arms’ meant, amongst the old masters, the Art of Fence. The sixteenth
    century was its Golden Age.</p>

  <p>At this time the Sword was not only the Queen of Weapons, but the
    weapon paramount between man and man. Then, advancing by slow,
    stealthy, and stumbling steps, the age of gunpowder, of ‘villanous
    saltpetre,’ appeared upon the scene of life. Gradually the bayonet, a
    modern modification of the pike, which again derives from the savage
    spear, one of the earliest forms of the <i lang="fr">arme blanche</i>, ousted the
    Sword amongst infantry because the former could be combined with
    the fire-piece. A century afterwards cavalrymen learned, in the
    Federal-Confederate war, to prefer the revolver and repeater, the
    breech-loader and the reservoir-gun, to the sabre of past generations.
    It became an axiom that in a cavalry charge the spur, not the Sword,
    gains the day. By no means a unique, nor even a singular process of
    progress, is this return towards the past, this falling back upon
    the instincts of primitive invention, this recurrence to childhood:
    when the science of war reverted to ballistics it practically revived
    the practice of the first ages, and the characteristic attack of
    the savage and the barbarian who, as a rule, throw their weapons.
    The cannon is the ballista, and the arblast, the mangonel, and
    the trebuchet, worked not by muscular but by chemical forces. The
    torpedo is still the old, old petard; the spur of the ironclad is the
    long-disused embolon, rostrum, or beak; and steam-power is a rough,
    cheap substitute for man-power, for the banks of oarsmen, whose work
    had a delicacy of manipulation unknown to machinery, however ingenious.
    The armed nations, which in Europe are again becoming the substitutes
    for standing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xv">xv</a></span>
    armies, represent the savage and barbarous stages of
    society, the proto-historic races, amongst which every man between
    the ages of fifteen and fifty is a man-at-arms. It is the same in
    moral matters; the general spread of the revolutionary spirit, of
    republicanism, of democratic ideas, of communistic, socialistic, and
    nihilistic rights and claims now acting so powerfully upon society
    and upon the brotherhood of nations, is a re-dawning of that early
    day when the peoples ruled themselves, and were not yet governed by
    priestly and soldier kings. It is the same even in the ‘immaterials.’
    The Swedenborgian school, popularly known by the trivial name
    <em>Spiritualism</em>, has revived magic, and this ‘new motor force,’ for such
    I call it, has resurrected the Ghost, which many a wise head supposed
    to have been laid for ever.</p>

  <p>The death-song of the Sword has been sung, and we are told that ‘Steel
    has ceased to be a gentleman.’<a id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Not so! and by no means so. These
    are mere insular and insulated views, and England, though a grand
    figure, the mother of nations, the modern Rome, is yet but a fraction
    of the world. The Englishman and, for that matter, the German and
    the Scandinavian, adopted with a protest, and right unwillingly,
    swordsmanship proper—that is, rapier and point, the peculiar and
    especial weapon, offensive and defensive, of Southern Europe, Spain,
    Italy, and France. During the most flourishing age of the Sword it is
    rare to find a blade bearing the name of an English maker, and English
    inscriptions seldom date earlier than the eighteenth century. The
    reason is evident. The Northerners hacked with hangers, they hewed with
    hatchets, and they cut with cutlasses because the arm suited their bulk
    and stature, weight and strength. But such weapons are the brutality
    of the Sword. In England swordsmanship is, and ever was, an exotic;
    like the sentiment, as opposed to the knowledge, of Art, it is the
    property of the few, not of the many; and, being rare, it is somewhat
    ‘un-English.’</p>

  <p>But the case is different on the continent of Europe. Probably at no
    period during the last four centuries has the Sword been so ardently
    studied as it is now by the Latin race in France and Italy. At no time
    have the schools been so distinguished for intellectual as well as for
    moral proficiency. The use of the foil ‘bated’ and ‘unbated’ has once
    more become quasi-universal. A duello, in the most approved fashion of
    our ancestors, was lately proposed (September 1882) by ten journalists
    of a Parisian paper, to as many on the staff of a rival publication.
    Even the softer sex in France and Italy has become cunning of fence;
    and women are among the most prosperous pupils of the <i lang="fr">salles d’armes</i>.
    Witness, for instance, the ill-fated Mdlle. Feyghine of the Théâtre
    Français, so celebrated for her skill in ‘the carte and the tierce and
    the reason demonstrative.’</p>

  <p>Nor is the cause of this wider diffusion far to seek. In the presence
    of arms of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvi">xvi</span>precision, the Sword, as a means of offence and defence,
    may practically fall for a time into disuse. It may no longer be the
    arm paramount or represent an idea. It may have come down from its
    high estate as tutor to the noble and the great. Yet not the less it
    has, and will ever have, its work to do. The Ex-Queen now appears as
    instructress-general in the art of arms. As the mathematic is the basis
    of all exact science, so Sword-play teaches the soldier to handle every
    other weapon. This is well known to Continental armies, in which each
    regiment has its own fencing establishment and its <i lang="fr">salle d’armes</i>.</p>

  <p>Again, men of thought cannot ignore the intrinsic value of the Sword
    for stimulating physical qualities. <i lang="fr">Ce n’est pas assez de roidir
    l’âme, il faut aussi roidir les muscles</i>, says Montaigne, who also
    remarks of fencing that it is the only exercise wherein <i lang="fr">l’esprit s’en
    exerce</i>. The best of callisthenics, this energetic educator teaches the
    man to carry himself like a soldier. A compendium of gymnastics, it
    increases strength and activity, dexterity and rapidity of movement.
    Professors calculate that one hour of hard fencing wastes forty ounces
    by perspiration and respiration. The foil is still the best training
    tool for the consensus of eye and hand; for the judgment of distance
    and opportunity; and, in fact, for the practice of combat. And thus
    swordsmanship engenders moral confidence and self-reliance while it
    stimulates a habit of resource; and it is not without suggesting, even
    in the schools, that ‘curious, fantastic, very noble generosity proper
    to itself alone.’</p>

  <p>And now when the vain glory of violence has passed away from the Sword
    with the customs of a past age, we can hardly ignore the fact that
    the manners of nations have changed, not for the best. As soon as the
    Sword ceased to be worn in France, a Frenchman said of his compatriots
    that the ‘politest people in Europe had suddenly become the rudest.’
    That gallant and courteous bearing, which in England during the early
    nineteenth century so charmed the ‘fiery and fastidious Alfieri’
    lingers only amongst a few. True the swash-buckler, the professional
    duellist, has disappeared. But courtesy and punctiliousness, the
    politeness of man to man, and respect and deference of man to
    woman—that <em>Frauencultus</em>, the very conception of the knightly
    character—have to a great extent been ‘improved off.’ The latter
    condition of society, indeed, seems to survive only in the most
    cultivated classes of Europe; and, popularly, amongst the citizens
    of the United States, a curious oasis of chivalry in a waste of bald
    utilitarianism—preserved not by the Sword but by the revolver. Our
    England has abolished the duello without substituting aught better for
    it: she has stopped the effect and left the cause.</p>

  <p>So far I have written concerning the Sword simply to show that my work
    does not come out ‘a day after the fair’; and that there is still a
    powerful vitality in the heroic Weapon. The details of such general
    statements will be established<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvii">xvii</span> and developed in the following pages.
    It is now advisable to introduce this volume to the reader.</p>

  <p>During the ‘seventies’ I began, with a light heart, my Book of the
    Sword, expecting to finish it within a few months. It has occupied me
    as many years. Not only study and thought, but travel and inspection,
    were found indispensable; a monograph on the Sword and its literature
    involved visiting almost all the great armouries of continental
    Europe, and a journey to India in 1875–6. The short period of months
    served only to show that a memoir of the Sword embraces the annals of
    the world. The long term of years has convinced me that to treat the
    subject in its totality is impossible within reasonable limits.</p>

  <p>It will hardly be said that a monograph of the Sword is not wanted.
    Students who would learn her origin, genealogy, and history, find
    no single publication ready to hand. They must ransack catalogues
    and books on ‘arms and armour’ that are numbered by the score. They
    must hunt up fugitive pamphlets; papers consigned to the literary
    store-rooms called magazines; and stray notices deep buried in the
    ponderous tomes of <cite>Recueils</cite> and general works on Hoplology. They must
    wade through volume after volume of histories and travels, to pick up
    a few stray sentences. And they will too often find that the index
    of an English book which gives copious references to glass or sugar
    utterly ignores the Sword. At times they must labour in the dark, for
    men who write seem wholly unconscious of the subject’s importance. For
    instance, much has been said about art in Japan; but our knowledge of
    her metallurgy especially of her iron and steel works, is elementary,
    while that of her peculiar and admirable cutlery is strangely
    superficial. And travellers and collectors treat the Sword much as they
    do objects of natural history. They regard only the rare, the forms
    which they ignore, or which strike the eye, and the unique specimens
    which may have no comparative value. Thus they neglect articles of far
    more interest and of higher importance to the student, and they bring
    home, often at great expense, mere lumber for curiosity shops.</p>

  <p>The difficulty of treating the Sword is enhanced by the peculiar
    individuality which characterises it, evidenced by an immense variety
    of physique, and resulting as much from unconscious selection as
    from deep design. One of the characteristics of indigenous art is
    that no two articles, especially no two weapons, are exactly alike;
    and yet they vary only within narrow and measurable limits. The
    minute differentiæ of the Sword are endless. Even in the present day,
    swordsmen will order some shape, size, or weight which they hold—often
    unwisely enough—to be improvements on the general. One man, wishing
    to strengthen his arm, devises a weapon fit for a Titan and finds it
    worse than useless. A tale is told of a Sheffield cutler who, having
    received from Maroccan Mogador a wooden model to be copied in steel,
    made several hundred blades on the same pattern and failed to find a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xviii">xviii</span>
    single purchaser. Their general resemblance to the prevailing type
    was marred by peculiarities which unsuited them for general use; they
    were adapted only to individual requirement, each man priding himself
    upon his own pattern having some almost imperceptible difference.
    Such variations are intelligible enough in the Sword, which must be
    modified for every personality, because it becomes to the swordsman a
    prolongation of his own person, a lengthening of the arm. The natural
    results are the protean shapes of the weapon and the difficulty of
    reducing these shapes to orderly description. I cannot, therefore,
    agree with a President of the Anthropological Institute (‘Journal,’
    October 1876) when he states: ‘Certainly the same forms of Sword might
    be found in different countries, but not of so peculiar a nature (as
    the Gaboon weapon) unless the form had been communicated.’ Shapes
    apparently identical start up spontaneously, because types are limited
    and man’s preferences easily traverse the whole range of his invention.</p>

  <p>Thus the stumbling-block which met me on the threshold was to
    introduce sequence, system, and lucid order into a chaos of details.
    It was necessary to discover some unity, some starting-place for
    evolution and development, without which all treatment would be vague
    and inconsequent. But where find the clue which makes straight the
    labyrinthine paths; the <i lang="fr">point de mire</i> which enables us to command the
    whole prospect; the coign of vantage which displays the disposition of
    details, together with the <i lang="la">nexus</i>, the intercommunication, and the
    progress of the parts and the whole?</p>

  <p>Two different systems of that ‘classification, which defines the
    margin of our ignorance,’ are adopted by museums; and, consequently,
    by the catalogues describing them. I shall here quote only English
    collections, leaving to the Continental reader the task of applying
    the two main principles locally and generally. These are, first, the
    Topical or Geographical (<i>e.g.</i> Christy collection), which, as the
    words denote, examines the article itself mainly with reference to its
    media, nature and culture, place and date; and which considers man and
    his works as the expression of the soil that bears him. The second is
    the Material and purely Formal (General A. Pitt-Rivers’ collection),
    which regards only the objects or specimens themselves, without respect
    to their makers or their media; and which, by investigating the rival
    laws of continuity and of incessant variation, aims at extending our
    knowledge of mankind. Both plans have their merits and their demerits.
    The Topical is the more strictly anthropologico-ethnological, because
    it makes the general racial culture its prominent feature; but it
    fails to illustrate, by juxtaposition, the origin, the life, and the
    death of a special article. The Formal proposes to itself the study of
    specific ideas; it describes their transmissions and their migrations;
    and it displays their connection and sequence, their development
    and degradation. It exemplifies the law of unconscious selection,
    as opposed to premeditation and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xix">xix</span> design. Thus it claims superior
    sociological interest, while it somewhat separates and isolates the
    article from its surroundings—mankind.</p>

  <p>Again, it would be unadvisable to neglect the chronological and
    synchronological order (Demmin’s). This assists us in tracing with
    a surer hand the origin and derivation; the annals, the adventures,
    and the accidents of an almost universal weapon, whose marvellously
    chequered career excels in dignity, in poetry, and in romance, anything
    and everything the world has yet seen. And here I have not been
    unmindful of Dr. Arthur Mitchell’s sensible warning that ‘the rude
    form of an implement may follow as well as precede the more finished
    forms.’<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Due regard to dates enables us to avoid the scandalous
    confusion of the vulgar museum. Demmin found a large number of swords
    catalogued as dating with the time of Charles the Bold, when the shapes
    proved that they belonged to the late sixteenth and even to the early
    seventeenth centuries. I was shown, in the museum of Aquileja, a ‘Roman
    sword’ which was a basket-hilted Venetian, hardly two hundred years
    old. It is only an exact chronology, made to frame the Geographical
    and the Formal pictures of the weapon, that can secure scientific
    distribution.</p>

  <p>In dealing with a subject which, like the Sword, ranges through the
    world-history, and which concerns the human race in general, it would,
    I venture to opine, be unwise to adopt a single system. As clearness
    can be obtained only by methodical distribution of matter, all the
    several processes must be combined with what art the artificer may.
    The Formal, which includes the Material, as well as the shape of the
    weapon, affords one fair basis for classification. The substance, for
    instance, ranges from wood to steel, and the profile from the straight
    line to the segment of a circle. The Topical, beginning (as far as we
    know) in the Nile Valley, and thence in ancient days overspreading
    Africa, Asia, Europe, and America, determines the distribution and
    shows the general continuity of the noble arm. It also readily
    associates itself with the chronologico-historical order, which begins
    <i lang="la">ab initio</i>, furnishes a proof of general progress, interrupted only by
    fitful stages of retrogression, and, finally, dwells upon the epochs of
    the highest interest.</p>

  <p>After not a little study I resolved to distribute the ‘Book of the
    Sword’ into three parts.</p>

  <p>Part I. treats of the birth, parentage, and early career of the Sword.
    It begins with the very beginning, in prehistoric times and amongst
    proto-historic peoples; and it ends with the full growth of the Sword
    at the epoch of the early Roman Empire.</p>

  <p>Part II. treats of the Sword fully grown. It opens with the rising
    civilisation <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xx">xx</span>of the Northern Barbarians and with the decline of Rome
    under Constantine (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 313–324), who combined Christianity
    with Mithraism; when the world-capital was transferred to Byzantium,
    and when an imitation of Orientalism, specially of ‘Persic apparatus,’
    led to the art decay which we denote by the term ‘Lower Empire.’ It
    proceeds to the rise of El-Islam; the origin of ordered chivalry and
    knighthood; the succession of the Crusades and the wars of arms and
    armour before the gunpowder age, when the general use of ballistics by
    means of explosives became the marking feature of battle. This was the
    palmy period of the Sword. It became a beautiful work of art; and the
    highest genius did not disdain to chase and gem the handle and sheath.
    And its career culminates with the early sixteenth century, when the
    weapon of offence assumed its defensive phase and rose to a height of
    splendour that prognosticated downfall, as surely as the bursting of a
    rocket precedes its extinction.</p>

  <p>Part III. continues the memoirs of the Sword, which, after long
    declining, revives once more in our day. This portion embraces
    descriptions of the modern blade, notices of collections, public and
    private, notes on manufactures; and, lastly, the bibliography and the
    literature connected with the Heroic Weapon.</p>

  <p>Part I., contained in this volume, numbers thirteen chapters, of which
    a bird’s-eye view is given by the List of Contents. The first seven
    are formally and chronologically arranged. Thus we have the Origin of
    Weapons (Chapter I.) showing that while the arm is common to man and
    beast, the weapon, as a rule, belongs to our kind. Chapter II. treats
    of the first weapon proper, the Stone, which gave rise to ballistics
    as well as to implements of percussion. Follows (Chapter III.) the
    blade of base materials, wood, stone and bone, materials still used
    by races which can procure nothing better. From this point a step
    leads to the metal blade, in its origin evidently a copy of preceding
    types. The first, (Chapter IV.) is of pure copper, in our translations
    generally rendered by ‘brass’ or ‘bronze.’ The intermediate substances
    (Chapter V.) are represented by alloys, a variety of mixed metals;
    and they naturally end with the so-called ‘age’ of early iron, which
    prevailed throughout Europe at a time when the valleys of the Nile and
    the Tigris-Euphrates wrought blades of the finest steel. This division
    concludes with a formal and technical Chapter (VII.) on the shape of
    the Sword and a description of its several parts. Here the subject does
    not readily lend itself to lively description; but, if I have been
    compelled to be dull, I have done my best to avoid being tedious.</p>

  <p>The arrangement then becomes geographical and chronological. My next
    five chapters are devoted to the Sword in its topical distribution and
    connection. The first (No. VIII.) begins with the various blade-forms
    in ancient Egypt, which extended throughout the then civilised world;
    it ends with showing that the Nile<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxi">xxi</span> valley gave their present shapes
    to the ‘white arm’ of the Dark Continent even in its modern day, and
    applied to the Sword the name which it still bears in Europe. The
    second (No. IX.) passes to Palestine, Syria, and Asia Minor, lands
    which manifestly borrowed the weapon from the Egyptians, and handed it
    on to Assyria, Persia, and India. The arms and armour of the ‘great
    Interamnian Plain’ afford material for a third (Chapter X.). Thence,
    retracing our steps and passing further westwards, we find manifest
    derivation and immense improvement of the Egyptian weapon in Greece
    (Chapter XI.), from which Mycenæ has lately supplied bronze rapiers
    perfectly formed as the steels of Bilboa and Toledo. The fifth Chapter
    (No. XII.) continues the ancient history of the Sword by describing
    the various blades of progressive Rome, whose wise choice and change
    of arms enabled her to gain the greatest battles with the least amount
    of loss. To this I have appended, for geographical and chronological
    symmetry, in a sixth and last chapter (No. XIII.), a sketch of the
    Sword among the contemporary Barbarians of the Roman Empire, Dacians,
    Italians, Iberians, Gauls, Germans, and the British Islands. This
    portion of the Sword history, however, especially the Scandinavian and
    the Irish, will be treated at full length in Part II.</p>

  <p>Here, then, ends the First Part, which Messrs. Chatto and Windus have
    kindly consented to publish, whilst my large collection of notes, the
    labour of years, is being ordered and digested for the other two. I may
    fairly hope, if all go well, to see both in print before the end of
    1884.</p>

  <p>In the following pages I have confined myself, as much as was possible,
    to the Sword; a theme which, indeed, offers an <i lang="fr">embarras de richesses</i>.
    But weapons cannot be wholly isolated, especially when discussing
    origins: one naturally derives from and connects with the other; and
    these relations may hardly be passed over without notice. I have,
    therefore, indulged in an occasional divagation, especially concerning
    the axe and the spear; but the main line has never been deserted.</p>

  <p>Nor need I offer an excuse for the amount of philological discussion
    which the nomenclature of the Sword has rendered necessary. If I have
    opposed the Past Masters of the art, my opposition has been honest,
    and I am ever open to refutation. Travellers refuse to believe that
    ‘Aryanism’ was born on the bald, bleak highlands of Central Asia, or
    that ‘Semitism’ derives from the dreary, fiery deserts of Arabia. We
    do not believe India to be ‘the country which even more than Greece or
    Rome was the cradle of grammar and philology.’ I cannot but hold that
    England has, of late years, been greatly misled by the ‘Aryan heresy’;
    and I look forward to the study being set upon a sounder base.</p>

  <p>The illustrations, numbering 293, have been entrusted to the artistic
    hands of Mr. Joseph Grego, who has taken a friendly interest in the
    work. But too much must not be expected from them in a book which
    intends to be popular, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxii">xxii</span> which is, therefore, limited in the matter
    of expense. Hence they are fewer than I should have desired. The
    libraries of Europe contain many catalogues of weapons printed in folio
    with highly finished and coloured plates which here would be out of
    place. That such a work upon the subject of the Sword will presently
    appear I have no doubt; and my only hope is that this volume will prove
    an efficient introduction.</p>

  <p>To conclude. I return grateful thanks to the many <i lang="de">mitwerkers</i> who have
    assisted me in preparing this monograph; no more need be said, as all
    names will be mentioned in the course of the work. A journey to the
    Gold Coast and its results, in two volumes, which describe its wealth,
    must plead my excuse for the delay in bringing out the book. The
    manuscript was sent home from Lisbon in December 1881, but the ‘tyranny
    of circumstance’ has withheld it for nearly two years.</p>

  <p class="clear mt10"><em>Postscript.</em> An afterthought suggests that it is only fair, both
    for readers and for myself, to own that sundry quotations have been
    borrowed at second-hand and that the work of verification, so rightly
    enjoined upon writers, has not always been possible. These blemishes
    are hardly to be avoided in a first edition. At Trieste, and other
    places distant from the great seats of civilisation, libraries of
    reference are unknown; and it is vain to seek for the original source.
    Indeed, Mr. James Fergusson once wrote to me that it was an overbold
    thing to undertake a History of the Sword under such circumstances.
    However, I made the best use of sundry visits to London and Paris,
    Berlin, Vienna, and other capitals, and did what I could to remedy
    defects. Lastly, the illustrations have not always, as they ought, been
    drawn to scale, they were borrowed from a number of volumes which paid
    scant attention to this requisite.</p>

    <li>Fox (A. Lane-, now Major-General A. Pitt-Rivers). This
    distinguished student of Anthropology, who ranks foremost
    in the knowledge of early weapons, happily applied the idea
    of evolution, development, and progress to his extensive
    collection, the work of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxvi">xxvi</span>some thirty years. To show the
    successive steps he grouped his objects according to their
    forms and uses, beginning with the simplest; and to each class
    he appended an ideal type, towards which the primitive races
    were ever advancing, making innumerable mistakes, in some cases
    even retrograding, but on the whole attaining a higher plane.
    The papers from which I have quoted, often word for word, in
    my first chapters, are (1) ‘Primitive Warfare,’ sect. i.,
    read on June 28, 1867 (pp. 1–35, with five plates), and Sect.
    ii., ‘On the Resemblance of the Weapons of Early Races, their
    Variations, Continuity, and Development of Form,’ read on June
    5, 1868 (pp. 1–42, with eight diagrams); and (2) ‘Catalogue
    of the Anthropological Collection lent for Exhibition in the
    Bethnal Green Branch of the South Kensington Museum, with (131)
    Illustrations;’ pt. I. and II. (III. and IV. to be published
    hereafter), 1874, &amp;c., 8vo., pp. 1–184. The collection, then
    containing some 14,000 objects, left Bethnal Green for the
    Western Galleries of the Museum in South Kensington. After a
    long sojourn there it was offered to the public; but England,
    unlike France, Germany, and Italy, has scant appreciation
    of anthropological study. At length it was presented to the
    University of Oxford, where a special building will be devoted
    to its worthy reception. I have taken the liberty of suggesting
    to General Pitt-Rivers that he owes the public not only the
    last two parts of his work, but also a folio edition with
    coloured illustrations of the humble ‘Catalogue.’</li>

    me copies of his two excellent papers, (1) ‘The Shape

    International Exhibition of 1862’ (<cite>Journal of the R.U.S.
    Institution</cite>, vols. vi. and vii.). With the author’s permission
    I have freely used these two valuable professional studies,
    especially in Chapter VII. The late Mr. Latham was a practical
    Swordsman, and his long experience as a maker of the ‘white
    arm’ renders his information thoroughly trustworthy. I wish
    every success to his son, who now fills his place in an
    establishment famous for turning out good work.</li>

  </div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Man’s</span> civilisation began with Fire—how to light it and how to keep it
    lit. Before he had taken this step, our primal ancestor (or ancestors)
    evidently led the life of the lower animals. The legend of ‘Iapetus’
    bold son’ Prometheus, like many others invented by the Greeks, or
    rather borrowed from Egypt, contained under the form of fable a deep
    Truth, a fact, a lesson valuable even in these days. ‘Forethought,’
    the elder brother of ‘Afterthought,’ brought down the <i lang="la">semina flammæ</i>
    in a hollow tube from Heaven, or stole it from the chariot of the
    Sun. Here we have the personification of the Great Unknown, who,
    finding a cane-brake or a jungle tree fired by lightning or flamed by
    wind-friction, conceived the idea of feeding the <span lang="grc">σπέρμα πυρὸς</span> with
    fuel. Thus Hermes or Mercury was ‘Pteropédilos’ or ‘Alipes;’ and his
    ankles were fitted with ‘Pedila’ or ‘Talaria,’ winged sandals, to show
    that the soldier fights with his legs as well as with his arms.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

  <p>I will not enlarge upon the imperious interest of Hoplology: the
    history of arms and armour, their connection and their transitions,
    plays the most important part in the annals of the world.</p>

  <p>The first effort of human technology was probably weapon-making.
    History <span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>and travel tell us of no race so rude as to lack artificial
    means of offence and defence.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> To these, indeed, man’s ingenuity and
    artistic efforts must, in his simple youthtide, have been confined. I
    do not allude to the complete man, created full-grown in body and mind
    by the priestly castes of Egypt, Phœnicia, Judæa, Assyria, Persia,
    and India. The <i>Homo sapiens</i> whom we have to consider is the ‘Adam
    Kadmon,’<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> not of the Cabbalist, but of the anthropologist, as soon
    as he raised himself above the beasts of the field by superiority of
    brains and hands.</p>

  <p>The lower animals are born armed, but not weaponed. The arm, indeed, is
    rather bestial than human: the weapon is, speaking generally, human,
    not bestial. Naturalists have doubted, and still doubt, whether in
    the so-called natural state the lower animals use weapons properly
    so termed. Colonel A. Lane Fox, a diligent student of primitive
    warfare, and a distinguished anthropologist,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> distinctly holds
    the hand-stone to be <em>the</em> prehistoric weapon. He quotes (Cat. pp.
    156–59) the ape using the hand-stone to crack nutshells; the gorillas
    defending themselves against the Carthaginians of Hanno; and Pedro de
    Cieza (Cieça) de Leon<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> telling us that ‘when the Spaniards [in Peru]
    pass under the trees where the monkeys are, these creatures break off
    branches and throw them down, making faces all the time.’ Even in
    the days of Strabo (xv. 1) it was asserted that Indian monkeys climb
    precipices, and roll down stones upon their pursuers—a favourite
    tactic with savages. Nor, indeed, is it hard to believe that the
    Simiads, whose quasi-human hand has prehensile powers, bombard their
    assailants with cocoa-nuts and other missiles. Major Denham (1821–24),
    a trustworthy traveller, when exploring about Lake Chad, says of the
    quadrumans of the Yeou country: ‘The monkeys, or, as the Arabs say, men
    enchanted (<i>Beny Adam meshood</i>),<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> were so numerous that I saw upwards
    of a hundred and fifty assembled at one place in the evening. They did
    not appear at all inclined to give up their ground, but, perched on the
    top of a bank some twenty feet high, made a terrible noise, and, rather
    gently than otherwise, pelted us as we approached within a certain
    distance.’ Herr Holub,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> also, was ‘designedly aimed at by a herd of
    African <span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>baboons perched among the trees;’ and on another occasion he
    and his men had to beat an ignominious retreat from ‘our cousins.’
    ‘Hence,’ suggests Colonel A. Lane Fox, ‘our “poor relation” conserves,
    even when bred abroad and in captivity, the habit of violently shaking
    the branch by jumping upon it with all its weight, in order that the
    detached fruit may fall upon the assailant’s head.’ In Egypt, as we see
    from the tomb-pictures, monkeys (baboons or cynocephali) were taught to
    assist in gathering fruit, and in acting as torch-bearers. While doing
    this last duty, their innate petulance caused many a merry scene.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

  <p>I never witnessed this bombardment by monkeys. But when my regiment
    was stationed at Baroda in Gujarát, several of my brother officers
    and myself saw an elephant use a weapon. The intelligent animal,
    which the natives call Háthi (‘the handed’<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>), was chained to a
    post during the dangerous season of the wet forehead, and was swaying
    itself in ill-temper from side to side. Probably offended by the sudden
    appearance of white faces, it seized with its trunk a heavy billet,
    and threw it at our heads with a force and a good will that proved the
    worst intention.</p>

  <p>According to Captain Hall—who, however, derived the tale from the
    Eskimos,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> the sole living representatives of the palæolithic age in
    Europe—the polar bear, traditionally reported to throw stones, rolls
    down, with its quasi-human forepaws, rocks and boulders upon the walrus
    when found sleeping at the foot of some overhanging cliff. ‘Meister
    Petz’ aims at the head, and finally brains the stunned prey with the
    same weapon. Perhaps the account belongs to the category of the ostrich
    throwing stones, told by many naturalists, including Pliny (x. 1),
    when, as Father Lobo explained in his ‘Abyssinia,’ the bird only kicks
    them up during its scouring flight. Similar, too, is the exploded
    shooting-out of the porcupine’s quills, whereby, according to mediæval
    ‘Shoe-tyes’<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> men have been
    badly hurt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span> and even killed. On the other
    hand, the Emu kicks like an Onager<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> and will drive a man from one
    side of a quarter-deck to the other.</p>

  <p>But though Man’s first work was to weapon himself, we must not believe
    with the Cynics and the Humanitarians that his late appearance in
    creation, or rather on the stage of life, initiated an unvarying and
    monotonous course of destructiveness. The great tertiary mammals which
    preceded him, the hoplotherium, the deinotherium, and other -theria,
    made earth a vast scene of bloodshed to which his feeble powers could
    add only a few poor horrors. And even in our day the predatory fishes,
    that have learned absolutely nothing from man’s inhumanity to man,
    habitually display as much ferocity as ever disgraced savage human
    nature.</p>

  <p>Primitive man—the post-tertiary animal—was doomed by the very
    conditions of his being and his media to a life of warfare; a course
    of offence to obtain his food, and of defence to retain his life.
    Ulysses<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> says pathetically:</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">No thing frailer of force than Man earth breedeth and feedeth;</div>
        <div class="i0">Man ever feeblest of all on th’ Earth’s face creeping and crawling.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">The same sentiment occurs in the ‘Iliad’; and Pliny, the pessimist,
    writes—‘the only tearful animal, Man.’</p>

  <p>The career of these wretches, who had neither ‘minds’ nor ‘souls,’
    was one long campaign against ravenous beasts and their ‘brother’
    man-brutes. Peace was never anything to them but a fitful interval of
    repose. The golden age of the poets was a dream; as Videlou remarked,
    ‘Peace means death for all barbarian races.’ The existence of our
    earliest ancestors was literally the Battle of Life. Then, as now, the
    Great Gaster was the first Master of Arts, and War was the natural
    condition of humanity upon which depends the greater part of its
    progress, its rising from the lower to the higher grade. Hobbism, after
    all, is partly right: ‘Men were by nature equal, and their only social
    relation was a state of war.’ Like the children of our modern day,
    helpless and speechless, primæval Homo possessed, in common with his
    fellow-creatures, only the instincts necessary for self-support under
    conditions the most facile. Uncultivated thought is not rich in the
    productive faculty; the brain does not create ideas: it only combines
    them and evolves the novelty of deduction, and the development of what
    is found existing. Similarly in language, onomatopœia, the imitation
    of natural sounds, the speech of Man’s babyhood, still endures; and to
    it we owe our more picturesque and life-like expressions. But, despite
    their feeble powers, compulsory instruction, the Instructor being Need,
    was continually urging the Savage and the Barbarian to evolve safety
    out of danger, comfort out of its contrary.</p>

  <p>For man, compelled by necessity of his nature to weapon himself,
    bears within <span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>him the two great principles of Imitation and Progress.
    Both are, after a fashion, his peculiar attributes, being rudimentary
    amongst the lower animals, though by no means wholly wanting. His
    capacity of language, together with secular development of letters and
    literature, enabled him to accumulate for himself, and to transmit
    to others, a store of experience acquired through the medium of the
    senses; and this, once gained, was never wholly lost. By degrees
    immeasurably slower than among civilised societies, the Savage digested
    and applied to the Present and to the Future the hoarded wisdom of
    the Past. The imitative faculty, a preponderating advantage of the
    featherless biped over the quadruped, taught the former, even in his
    infancy, to borrow <i lang="la">ad libitum</i>, while he lent little or nothing.
    As a quasi-solitary Hunter<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> he was doomed to fray and foray, to
    destroying others in order to preserve himself and his family: a
    condition so constant and universal as to include all others. Become a
    Shepherd, he fought man and beast to preserve and increase his flocks
    and herds; and rising to an Agriculturist, he was ever urged to break
    the peace by greed of gain, by ambition, and by the instinctive longing
    for excitement.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

  <p>But there was no absolute point of separation, as far as the material
    universe is concerned, to mark the dawn of a new ‘creative period’; and
    the <i>Homo Darwiniensis</i> made by the Aristotle of our age, the greatest
    of English naturalists, is directly connected with the <i>Homo sapiens</i>.
    There are hosts of imitative animals, birds as well as beasts; but the
    copying-power is essentially limited. Moreover, it is ‘instinctive,’
    the work of the undeveloped, as opposed to ‘reasoning,’ the process of
    the highly-developed brain and nervous system. Whilst man has taught
    himself to articulate, to converse, the dog, which only howled and
    whined, has learned nothing except to bark. Man, again, is capable of
    a development whose bounds we are unable to determine; whereas the
    beast, incapable of self-culture, progresses, under the most favourable
    circumstances, automatically and within comparatively narrow bounds.</p>

  <p>Upon the imitative faculty and its exercise I must dwell at greater
    length. It is regretable that the delicious wisdom of Pope neglected
    to point out the great lesson of the animal-world in suggesting and
    supplying the arts of offence and defence:—</p>

  <p class="noindent">Man, especially in the tropical and sub-tropical zones—his
    early, if not his earliest, home, long ago whelmed beneath the ocean
    waves—would derive many a useful hint from the dreadful armoury of
    equinoctial vegetation; the poison-trees, the large strong spines of
    the Acacia and the Mimosa, <i>e.g.</i> the Wait-a-bit (<i>Acacia detinens</i>),
    the Gleditschia, the Socotrine Aloe, the American Agave, and the
    piercing thorns of the <i>Caryota urens</i>, and certain palms. The
    aboriginal races would be further instructed in offensive and defensive
    arts by the powerful and destructive <i lang="la">feræ</i> of the sunny river-plains,
    where the Savage was first induced to build permanent abodes.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>DISTRIBUTION OF WEAPONS.</i></div>

  <p>Before noting the means of attack and protection which Nature
    suggested, we may distribute Hoplology, the science of arms and weapons
    of offence and defence, human and bestial, into two great orders, of
    which the latter can be subdivided into four species:—</p>

  <p class="noindent">My list is less comprehensive, and it bears only upon the origin
    of the <i lang="fr">Arme blanche</i>.</p>

  <p>I. As has been said, the missile, the <span lang="grc">βέλος</span>, is probably the first
    form of weapon, and is still the favourite with savage Man. It favours
    the natural self-preservative instinct. <i>El-Khauf maksúm</i>—‘fear is
    distributed,’—say the Arabs. ‘The shorter the weapon the braver the
    wielder’ has become a well-established fact. The savage Hunter, whose
    time is his own, would prefer the missile; but the Agriculturist,
    compelled to be at home for seed-time and harvest, would choose the
    hand-to-hand <span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>weapon which shortens action. We may hold, without
    undue credulity, that the throwing-arm is common to beasts, after a
    fashion, and to man. Among the so-called ‘missile fishes’<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> the
    Toxotes,<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> or Archer, unerringly brings down insects with a drop
    of water when three or four feet high in the air. The Chætodon, or
    archer fish of Japan, is kept in a glass vase, and fed by holding flies
    at the end of a rod a few inches above the surface: it strikes them
    with an infallible aim. This process is repeated, among the mammalia,
    by the Llama, the Guanaco and their congeners, who propel their
    acrid and fetid saliva for some distance and with excellent aim.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
    And stone-throwing held its own for many an age, as we read in the
    fifteenth century:—</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">Use eke the cast of stone with slynge or honde;</div>

  <p>II. The stroke or blow which led to the cut would be seen exemplified
    in the felidæ, by the terrible buffet of the lion, by the clawing
    of the tiger and the bear, and by the swing of the trunk of the
    ‘half-reasoner with the hand.’ Man also would observe that the zebra
    and the quagga (so called from its cry, <i>wag-ga, wag-ga</i><a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>), the
    horse and the ass, the camel, the giraffe, and even the cow, defend
    themselves with the kick or hoof-blow; while the ostrich, the swan, and
    the larger birds of prey assault with a flirt or stroke of the wing.
    The aries or sea-ram (<i>Delphinus orca</i>) charges with a butt. The common
    whale raises the head with such force that it has been held capable
    of sinking a whaler: moreover, this mammal uses the huge caudal fin
    or tail in battle with man and beast; for instance, when engaged with
    the fox-shark or thresher (<i>Carcharias vulpes</i>).<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> These, combined
    with the force of man’s doubled fist, would suggest the ‘noble art’
    of boxing: it dates from remote antiquity; witness the cestus or
    knuckle-duster of the classics, Greeks, Romans, and Lusitanians. So
    far from being confined to Great or Greater Britain, as some suppose,
    it is still a favourite not only with the Russian peasants, but also
    with the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>Hausas, Moslem negroids who did such good service in the
    Ashanti war. A curious survival of the feline armature is the Hindu’s
    Wágh-nakh. Following Demmin, Colonel A. Lane Fox<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> was in error when
    he described this ‘tiger’s-claw’ as ‘an Indian weapon of treachery
    belonging to a secret society, and invented about <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1659.’
    Demmin<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> as erroneously attributes the Wágh-nakh to Sívají, the
    Prince of Maráthá-land in Western India, who traitorously used it upon
    Afzal Khan, the Moslem General of Aurangzeb, sent (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1659)
    to put down his rebellion.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> A meeting of the chiefs was agreed upon,
    and the Moslem, quitting his army, advanced with a single servant; he
    wore a thin robe, and carried only a straight sword. Sívají, descending
    from the fort, assumed a timid and hesitating air, and to all
    appearance was unarmed. But he wore mail under his flimsy white cotton
    coat, and besides a concealed dagger, he carried his ‘tiger’s-claw.’
    The Khan looked with contempt at the crouching and diminutive ‘mountain
    rat,’ whom the Moslems threatened to bring back in cages; but, at
    the moment of embracing, the Maráthá struck his Wágh-nakh into his
    adversary’s bowels and despatched him with his dagger. The Wágh-nakh
    in question is still kept as a relic, I am told, by the Bhonslá
    family.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Outside the hand you see nothing but two solid gold rings
    encircling the index and the minimus; these two are joined inside by
    a steel bar, which serves as a connecting base to three or four sharp
    claws, thin enough to fit between and to be hidden by the fingers of a
    half-closed hand. The attack is by <span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>ripping open the belly: and I have
    heard of a poisoned Wágh-nakh which may have been suggested by certain
    poison rings in ancient and mediæval Europe.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> The date of invention
    is absolutely unknown, and a curious and instructive modification of it
    was made by those Indians-in-Europe, the Gypsies.</p>

  <p class="clear">III. The thrust would be suggested by the combats of the goat, the
    stag, and black cattle, including the buffalo and the wild bull, all
    of which charge at speed with the head downwards, and drive the horns
    into the enemy’s body. The gnu (<i>Catoblepas G.</i>) and other African
    antelopes, when pressed by the hunter, keep him at bay with the point.
    In Europe ‘hurt of hart,’ a ripping and tearing thrust, has brought
    many a man to the grave. The hippopotamus, a dangerous animal unduly
    despised, dives under the canoe, like the walrus, rises suddenly, and
    with its lower tusks, of the hardest ivory, drills two holes in the
    offending bottom. The black rhinoceros, fiercest and most irritable
    of African fauna, though graminivorous, has one or two horns of
    wood-like fibre-bundles resting upon the strongly-arched nasal bones,
    and attached by an extensive apparatus of muscles and tendons. This
    armature, loose when the beast is at peace, becomes erect and immovable
    in rage, thus proving in a special manner its only use—that of war. It
    is a formidable dagger that tears open the elephant and passes through
    the saddle and its padding into the ribs of a horse. The extinct
    sabre-toothed tiger (<i>Machairodus latidens</i>), with one incisor and five
    canines, also killed with a thrust. So, amongst birds, the bittern,
    the peacock, and the American white crane peck or stab at the eye;
    the last-named has been known to drive its long sharp mandibles deep
    into the pursuer’s bowels, and has been caught by presenting to it a
    gun-muzzle; the bird, mistaking the hole, strikes at it and is caught
    by the beak.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> The hern defends herself during flight by presenting
    the sharp long beak to the falcon. The pheasant and partridge, the
    domestic cock and quail, to mention no others, use their spurs with
    a poniard’s thrust; the Argus-pheasant of India, the American Jacaná
    (<i>Parra</i>), the horned screamer (<i>Palamedea</i>), the wing-wader of
    Australia (Gregory), and the plover of Central Africa (Denham and
    Claperton), carry weapons upon their wings.</p>

  <p>According to Pliny (viii. 38) the dolphins which enter the Nile are
    armed with a knife-edged spur on the back to protect themselves
    from the crocodiles. Cuvier refers this allusion to the <i>Squalus
    centrina</i> or <i>Spinax</i> of Linnæus. The European ‘file-fish’ (<i>Balistes
    capriscus</i>), found in a fossil state, and still existing, though
    rare in British waters, remarkably shows the efficiency, beauty, and
    variety of that order’s armature. It pierces its enemy from beneath
    by a strong erectile and cirrated spine on the first anterior dorsal;
    the base of the spear is expanded and perforated, and a bolt from the
    supporting plate passes freely through it. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>When the spine is raised, a
    hollow at the back receives a prominence from the next bony ray, which
    fixes the point in an erect position. Like the hammer of a fire-piece
    at full cock, the spear cannot be forced down till the prominence is
    withdrawn, as by pulling the trigger. This mechanism, says the learned
    and experienced Professor Owen,<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> may be compared with the fixing and
    unfixing of a bayonet: when the spine is bent down it is received into
    a groove in the supporting plate, and thus it offers no impediment to
    swimming.</p>

  <p>The pugnacious and voracious little ‘stickleback’ (<i>Gasterosteus</i>) is
    similarly provided. The ‘bull-head’ (<i>Cottus diceraus</i>, Pallas<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>)
    bears a multibarbed horn on its dorsum, exactly resembling the spears
    of the Eskimos and the savages of South America and Australia. The
    yellow-bellied ‘surgeon’ or lancet-fish (<i>Acanthurus</i>) is armed, in
    either ocean, with a long spine on each side of the tail; with this
    lance it defends itself dexterously against its many enemies. The
    <i>Naseus fronticornis</i> (Lacépède) bears, besides the horn-muzzle,
    trenchant spear-formed blades in the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>pointed and serrated tail.
    The sting-fish or adder-pike (<i>Trachinus vipera</i>) has necessitated
    amputation of the wounded limb: the dorsals, as well as the opercular
    spines, have deep double grooves in which the venomous mucous secretion
    is lodged—a hint to dagger-makers. The sting-rays (<i>Raia trygon</i>
    and <i>R. histrix</i><a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>) twist the long slender tail round the object
    of attack and cut the surface with the strong notched and spiny
    edge, inflicting a wound not easily healed. The sting, besides being
    poisonous, has the especial merit of breaking off in the wound: it
    is extensively used by the savages of the Fiji, the Gambier, and the
    Pellew Islands, of Tahiti, Samoa, and many of the Low Islands.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
    These properties would suggest poisoned weapons which cannot be
    extracted. Such are the arrows of the Bushman, the Shoshoni, and the
    Macoinchi of Guiana, culminating in the highly-civilised stiletto of
    hollow glass.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The sword-fish (<i>Xiphias</i>), although a vegetable feeder, is mentioned
    by Pliny (xxxii. 6) as able to sink a ship. It is recorded to have
    killed a man when bathing in the Severn near Worcester. It attacks
    the whale, and it has been known to transfix a vessel’s side with its
    terrible weapon. The narwhal or sea-unicorn (<i>Monodon monoceros</i>)
    carries a formidable tusk, a Sword-blade of the same kind similarly
    used.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

  <p>Here may be offered a single proof how Man, living among, and
    dependent for food upon, the lower animals, borrowed from their habits
    and experience his earliest practice of offence and defence. The
    illustration represents a ‘Singhauta,’<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> ‘Mádu’ or ‘Máru’ (double
    dagger), made from the horns of the common Indian antelope, connected
    by crossbars. In its rude state, and also tipped with metal, it is
    still used as a weapon by <span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>the wild Bhíls, and as a crutch and dagger
    by the Jogis (Hindús) and Fakirs (Hindís or Moslems), both orders
    of religious mendicants who are professionally forbidden to carry
    secular arms. It also served for defence, like the parrying-stick of
    Africa and Australia, till it was fitted with a hand-guard, and the
    latter presently expanded into a circular targe of metal. This ancient
    instrument, with its graceful curves, shows four distinct stages of
    development: first, the natural, and, secondly, the early artificial,
    with metal caps to make it a better thrusting weapon. The third process
    was to forge the whole of metal; and the fourth and final provided
    it with a straight, broad blade, springing at right angles from the
    central grip. This was the ‘Adaga’<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> of mediæval writers.</p>

  <div class="figleft">
    <a id="f008"><img src="images/i_012_f008.jpg" width="108" height="259" alt="" /></a>
    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 8.—The Adaga.</span></div>
  </div>

  <p>IV. The first idea of a trenchant or cutting instrument would be
    suggested by various reeds and grasses; their silicious leaves at
    certain angles cleave to the bone, as experience has taught most
    men who have passed through a jungle of wild sugar-cane. When
    full-grown the plants stand higher than a man’s head, and the
    flint-edged leaves disposed in all directions suggest a labyrinth of
    sword-blades. Thus the Mawingo-wingo (<i>Pennisetum Benthami</i>), like
    the horse-tail or ‘shave-grass’ of Spain, was used as knives by the
    executioners of Kings Sunna and Mtesa of Uganda, when cutting the
    human victims to pieces.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Of the same kind are the ‘sword-grass’
    and the ‘bamboo-grass.’ Many races, especially the Andamanese and the
    Polynesian Islanders, make useful blades of the split and sharpened
    bamboo: they are fashioned from the green plant, and are dried and
    charred to sharpen the edge. Turning to the animal world, the cassowary
    tears with a forward cut, and the wounded coot scratches like a cat.
    The ‘old man kangaroo,’ with the long nail of the powerful hind leg,
    has opened the stomach of many a staunch hound. The wild boar attacks
    with a thrust, followed by a rip, cutting scientifically from below
    upwards. This, as will appear, is precisely the plan adopted by certain
    ancient forms of sabre, Greek and barbarian, the cutting edges being
    inside, not outside, the curve. I may add that the old attack is one of
    our latest improvements in broadsword exercise.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span></p>

  <p>The offensive weapon of the sting-ray, and of various insects, as well
    as the teeth of all animals, man included, furnish models for serrated
    or saw-edged instruments. Hence Colonel A. Lane Fox observes:<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> ‘It
    is not surprising that the first efforts of mankind in the construction
    of trenchant instruments should so universally consist of teeth, or
    flint-flakes, arranged along the edge of staves.’ But evidently the
    knife preceded the saw, which is nothing but a knife-blade jagged.
    Other familiar instances would be the multibarb stings of insects,
    especially that of the common bee. Again, we have the mantis, an
    orthopter of the Temperates and the Tropics, whose fights, enjoyed by
    the Chinese, are compared with the duels of sabrers. For the rasping
    blow and parry they use the forearm, which carries rows of strong
    sharp spines; and a happy stroke beheads or bisects the antagonist.
    To this category belongs the armature of the saw-fish (<i>Pristis</i>),
    a shark widely <span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>distributed and haunting the arctic, temperate, and
    tropical seas. Its mode of offence is to spring high from the water and
    to fall upon the foe, not with the point, but with either edge of its
    formidable arm: the row of strong and trenchant barbs, set like teeth,
    cuts deeply into the whale’s flesh. Hence, in New Guinea, the serrated
    blade becomes a favourite Sword, the base of the snout being cut and
    rounded so as to form a handle.</p>

  <p>Thus man, essentially a tool-making animal, and compelled by the
    conditions of his being to one long battle with the brute creation,
    was furnished by his enemies, not only with models of implements and
    instruments, and with instructions to use them, from witnessing the
    combats of brutes, but actually with their arms, which he converted
    to his own purposes. Hence the weapon and the tool were, as a rule,
    identical in the hands of primæval man; and this forms, perhaps, the
    chief test of a primitive invention. The earliest drift-flints ‘were
    probably used as weapons both of war and the chase, to grub roots, to
    cut down trees, and to scoop out canoes.’<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> The Watúsi of Eastern
    Africa make their baskets with their sharpened spear-heads; and the
    so-called Káfirs (Amazulu, &amp;c.) still shave themselves with the
    assegai. Hence, too, as like conditions engender like results, the arms
    and implements of different races resemble one another so closely as to
    suggest a common origin and actual imitation, even where copying was,
    so to speak, impossible.</p>

  <p>Let us take as an instance two of the most widespread of weapons.
    The blow-pipe’s progressive form has been independently developed
    upon a similar plan, with distinctly marked steps, in places the most
    remote.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Another instance is the chevaux-de-frise, the spikes of
    metal familiar to the classics.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> They survive in the caltrops or
    bamboo splints planted in the ground by the barefooted Mpangwe (Fans)
    of Gaboon-land and by the Rangos of Malacca.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span></p>

  <p>In the early days of anthropological study we read complaints that
    ‘it is impossible to establish, amongst the implements of modern
    savages, a perfectly true sequence,’ although truth may be arrived
    at in points of detail; and that ‘in regard to the primary order of
    development, much must still be left open to conjecture.’ But longer
    labour and larger collections have lately added many a link to the
    broken chain of continuity. We can now trace with reasonable certainty
    the tardy progress of evolution which, during a long succession of
    ages, led to the systematised art of war. The conditions of the latter
    presently allowed society periods of rest, or rather of recovery; and
    more leisure for the practice which, in weapons as in other things,
    ‘maketh perfect.’<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> And man has no idea of finality: he will stop
    short of nothing less than the absolutely perfect. He will labour at
    the ironclad as he did the canoe; at the fish-torpedo as he did the
    petard.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>ARMS AND ARTS.</i></div>

  <p>From the use of arms, also, arose the rudimentary arts of savage man.
    Music began when he expressed his joy and his sorrow by cries of
    emotion—the voice being the earliest, as it is still the best, of
    music-makers. It was followed by its imitations, which pass through
    three several stages, and even now we know nothing more in the way of
    development.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> When the savage clapped together two clubs he produced
    the first or drum-type; when he hissed or whistled he originated the
    pipe-type (syrinx, organ, bagpipe, &amp;c.); and the twanging of his bow
    suggested the lyre-type, which we still find—‘tickling the dried guts
    of a mewing cat.’<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> Painting and sculpture were the few simple lines
    drawn and cut upon the tomahawk or other rude weapon-tool. ‘As men
    think and live so they build,’ said Herder; and architecture, which
    presently came to embrace all the other arts, dawned when the Savage
    attempted to defend and to adorn his roost among the tree branches or
    the entrance to his cave-den.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

  <p>After this preamble, which has been longer than I expected, we pass to
    the first or rudest forms of the Weapons Proper used by Savage Man.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">What</span>, then, was Man’s first weapon? He was born speechless and
    helpless, inferior to the beasts of the field. He grew up armed, but
    badly armed. His muscles may have been stronger than they are now; his
    poor uneducated fisticuff, however, could not have compared with the
    kick of an ass. As we see from the prognathous jaw, he could bite, and
    his teeth were doubtless excellent<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>; still, the size and shape of
    the maxilla rendered it an arm inferior to the hyæna’s and even to the
    dog’s. He scratched and tore, as women still do; but his nails could
    hardly have been more dangerous than the claws of the minor felines.</p>

  <p>He had, however, the hand, the most perfect of all prehensile
    contrivances, and Necessity compelled him to use it. The stone, his
    first ‘weapon,’ properly so called, would serve him in two ways—as a
    missile, and as a percussive instrument. Our savage progenitor, who
    in days long before the dawn of history, contracted the extensor and
    relaxed the flexor muscles of his arm when flinging into air what he
    picked up from the ground, was unconsciously lengthening his reach
    and taking the first step in the art and science of ballistics. His
    descendants would acquire extraordinary skill in stone-throwing,
    and universal practice would again make perfect. Diodorus of Sicily
    (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 44),<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> who so admirably copied Herodotus, says that
    the Libyans ‘use neither Swords, spears, nor other weapons; but only
    three darts and stones in certain leather budgets, wherewith they
    fight in pursuing and retreating.’ The Wánshi (Guanches) Libyan or
    Berber peoples of the Canarian Archipelago, according to Cà da Mosto
    (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1505), confirmed by many, including George Glas,<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
    were expert stone-throwers. They fought their duels ‘in the public
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>place, where the combatants mounted upon two stones placed at the
    opposite sides of it, each stone being flat at top and about half a
    yard in diameter. On these they stood fast without moving their feet,
    till each had thrown three round stones at his antagonist. Though they
    were good marksmen, yet they generally avoided those missive weapons by
    the agile writhing of their bodies. Then arming themselves with sharp
    flints (obsidian?) in their left hands, and cudgels or clubs in their
    right, they fell on, beating and cutting each other till they were
    tired.’ An instance is mentioned in which a Guanche brought down with a
    single throw a large palm-frond, whose mid-rib was capable of resisting
    the stroke of an axe. Kolben, who wrote about a century and a half ago,
    gives the following account of the ape-like gestures of the Khoi-Khoi
    or Hottentots<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>:—‘The most surprising strokes of their dexterity
    are seen in their throwing of a stone. They hit a mark to a miracle
    of exactness, though it be a hundred paces distant and no bigger than
    a halfpenny. I have beheld them at this exercise with the highest
    pleasure and astonishment, and was never weary of the spectacle. I
    still expected after repeated successes, that the stone would err; but
    I expected in vain. Still went the stone right to the mark, and my
    pleasure and astonishment were redoubled. You could imagine that the
    stone was not destined to err, or that you were not destined to see it.
    But a Hottentot’s unerring hand in this exercise is not the only wonder
    of the scene; you would be equally struck perhaps with the manner in
    which he takes his aim. He stands, not still with a lift-up arm and a
    steady staring eye upon the mark, as we do; but is in constant motion,
    skipping from one side to another, suddenly stooping, suddenly rising;
    now bending on this side, now on that; his eyes, hands, and feet are
    in constant action, and you would think that he was playing the fool,
    and minding anything else than his aim; when on a sudden, away goes the
    stone with a fury, right to the heart of the mark, as if some invisible
    power had directed it.’</p>

  <p>Nearer home the modern Syrians still preserve their old dexterity: I
    have often heard the tale, and have no reason to doubt its truth, of
    a brown bear (<i>Ursus syriacus</i>) being killed in the Libanus by a blow
    between the eyes.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> When the Arab Bedawin are on the raid and do not
    wish to use their matchlocks, they attack at night, and ‘rain stones’
    upon the victim. The latter vainly discharges <span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>his ammunition against
    the shadows flitting ghost-like among the rocks; and, when his fire
    is drawn, the murderers rush in and finish their work. The use of the
    stone amongst the wild tribes of Asia, Africa, and America is almost
    universal. In Europe, the practice is confined to schoolboys; but the
    wild Irish, by beginning early, become adepts in it when adults. As a
    rule, the shepherd is everywhere a skilful stone-thrower.</p>

  <p>Turner makes the ‘Kawas’ of Tanna, New Hebrides, a stone as long
    as, and twice as thick as, an ordinary counting-house ruler: it is
    thrown with great precision for a distance of twenty yards. The same
    author mentions stones rounded like a cannon-ball, among the people
    of Savage Island and Eromanga. Commander Byron notices the stones
    made into missiles by the Disappointment Islanders. Beechey, whose
    party was attacked by the Easter Islanders, says that the weapons,
    cast with force and accuracy, knocked several of the seamen under
    the boat-thwarts. Crantz tells us that Eskimo children are taught
    stone-throwing at a mark as soon as they can use their hands. The late
    Sir R. Schomburg describes a singular custom amongst the Demarara
    Indians. When a child enters boyhood he is given a hard round stone
    which he is to hand-rub till it becomes smooth, and he often reaches
    manhood before the task is done. Observers have suggested that the only
    use of the practice is a ‘lesson in perseverance, which quality, in the
    opinion of many people, is best inculcated by engaging the minds of
    youths in matters that are devoid of any other incentive in the way of
    practical utility or interest.’</p>

    <div class="caption smcap">Fig. 13.—Ancient Egyptians Throwing Knives.</div>
  </div>

  <p>In more civilised times the knife, as a missile, would take the place
    of the stone. We find that the ancient Egyptians<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> practised at a
    wooden block, and the German <i lang="de">Helden</i> (champions), seated on settles,
    duelled by casting three knives each, to be parried with the shield.
    The modern Spaniards begin to learn when children the art of throwing
    the <i>facon</i><a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>, <i>cuchillo</i> or clasp-knife. The reapers <span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>of the Roman
    Campagna, mere barbarians once civilised, also ‘chuck’ the sickle with
    a surprising precision.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>THE BOW.</i></div>

  <p>The habit of stone-throwing would presently lead to the invention of
    the sling, which Meyrick considers,<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> strange to say, the ‘earliest
    and simplest weapon of antiquity.’ The rudest form of this pastoral
    weapon used only on open plains, a ball and cord, was followed by
    the various complications of string- or thong-sling, cup-sling, and
    stick-sling. The latter, a split stick which held the stone till the
    moment of discharge, may have been the primitive arm: Lepsius shows
    an Egyptian using such a sling and provided with a reserve heap of
    pebbles. Nilsson suggests that David was thus weaponed when Goliath
    addressed him, ‘Am I a dog that thou comest to me with staves?’—that
    is, with the shepherd’s staff turned into a sling. And this form
    survived longest in the Roman ‘fustibulus,’ which the moderns corrupted
    to ‘fustibale’<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>: the latter, with its wooden handle, was used in
    Europe during the twelfth century, and was employed in delivering
    hand-grenades till the sixteenth. The primitive ball-and-cord, known
    to the ancient Egyptians, is still preserved in the Bolas of the
    South American Gaucho. A simultaneously invented missile would be the
    hurling or throwing-stick and its modification, the Boomerang, of which
    I have still to speak. The application of elasticity and resilience
    being now well known, would suggest the rudest form of the bow<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> and
    arrow. This invention, next in importance (though <i lang="la">longo intervallo</i>)
    to fire-making and fire-feeding, is the first crucial evidence of the
    distinction between the human weapon and the bestial arm. Nilsson and
    many others hold the invention to have been instinctive and common to
    all peoples; and we cannot wonder that it was made the invention of
    demi-gods—Nimrod, Scythes<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> the son of Jupiter, or Perses son of
    Perseus.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> The missile arm at once showed man and beast separated
    by an extensive difference of degree, if not of kind, and it has
    played the most notable part, perhaps, of all weapons in the annals of
    humanity or inhumanity. It led to the Greek <i lang="grc-Latn">gastrapheta</i>, the Roman
    <i lang="la">arcubalista</i> (crossbow<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>); to the <i lang="la">palintonon</i> or <i>balista</i>, and
    the arblast (an enlarged species of the <i>arcus</i>, intended for throwing
    darts of giant size); to the <i>Belagerungs-balister</i>, a fixed form; to
    the catapult, <i lang="la">enthytonon</i>, <i lang="la">tormentum</i>, scorpion or <i lang="la">onager</i>,<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span> and
    to other formidable forms of classical artillery which preceded the
    ‘cheap and nasty’ invention of chemical explosives.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>THE CLUB.</i></div>

  <p>So much for the Hand-stone as the forefather of missiles and of
    ballistic science. Held in the fist it would give momentum, weight
    and velocity, force and bruising power, to the blow. Thus it was the
    forerunner of the club, straight and curved; the flail, the <i lang="fr">bâton
    ferré</i>, the ‘morning star,’ the ‘holy-water sprinkler,’ and a host of
    similar weapons<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> that added another and a harder joint to man’s
    arm. Clubs—which in practice are aimed at the head, whereas the spear
    is mostly directed at the body<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>—would be easily made by pulling
    up a straight young tree, or by tearing down a branch from the parent
    trunk and stripping it of twigs and leaves. The club of Australia,
    a continent to which we look for original forms, has the branching
    rootlets trimmed to serve as spikes; moreover, the terminal bulge has
    been developed in order to stop or parry the assailant’s weapon. In
    fact the swell, ball, lozenge, or mushroom-head was the first germ of
    the Australasian shield. The next step would be to fashion the ragged
    staff with fire, with friction, and with flint knives, shells or other
    scrapers, into a cutting as well as a crushing instrument; and here we
    have one of the many origins of the Sword and of its diminutives, the
    dagger and the knife. Pointed at the end, it would become the lance
    and spear, the spud, spade, and palstave, the <i lang="la">pilum</i>, the dart, the
    javelin, and the assagai.</p>

  <p>Not a few authorities contend that the earliest weapons, the most
    constant in all ages and continuous in all countries, were the
    spear and the axe. The first would be a development of the pointed
    hand-celt<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>; the latter of the leaf-formed or almond-shaped tool.
    But firstly, these would be mostly confined to countries with a
    well-developed Stone Age<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>; and secondly, the conversion of the
    hand-stone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span> into an
    <i lang="fr">arme d’hast</i> would assuredly be later than the club
    and the sharpened stick or stake.</p>

  <p>Herodotus, the father of ancient history in its modern form, a
    travelled student and a great genius, whose prose poem—for such it
    is—has proved incomparably more useful to us than any works of his
    successors, when describing a rock-sculpture of Sesostris-Ramses (ii.
    106) makes him carry in his right hand a spear (Egyptian), and in his
    left a bow (Lybian or Ethiopian). Hence some writers on Hoplology have
    held that he considered these to be the oldest of weapons. But the
    ancients did not study prehistoric man beyond confounding human bones
    with those of extinct mammals. Augustus Cæsar was an early collector,
    according to Suetonius (in ‘August.’ c. xxii.). ‘Sua vero ... excoluit
    rebusque vetustate ac raritate notabilibus; qualia sunt Capræis immanum
    belluarum ferarumque membra prægrandia, quæ dicuntur gigantum ossa et
    arma heroum.’<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> The Emperor (whom the late Louis Napoleon so much
    resembled, even in the matter of wearing hidden armour<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>) preferred
    these curiosities to statues and pictures. The ancients also, like
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>Marco Polo and too many of the moderns, spoke of the world generally
    after studying a very small part in particular. The Halicarnassian here
    evidently alludes to an epoch which had made notable advances upon the
    Quaternary Congener of the Simiads. We must return to a much earlier
    age. Lucretius, whose penetrating genius had a peculiar introvision,
    wrote like a modern scientist:—</p>

    after the marvel-myths of man’s Creation propounded by the so-called
    ‘revealed’ religions.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>THE ‘AGES.’</i></div>

  <p>For the better distribution of the subject I shall here retain the
    obsolete and otherwise inadmissible, because misleading, terms—Age
    of Stone, Age of Bronze, Age of Iron.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> From the earliest times
    all the metals were employed, without distinction, for weapons
    offensive and defensive: besides which, the three epochs intermingle
    in all countries, and overlap one another; they are, in fact, mostly
    simultaneous rather than successive. As a modern writer says, like
    the three principal colours of the rainbow, these three stages
    of civilisation shade off the one <span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>into the other; and yet their
    succession, as far as Western Europe<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> is concerned, appears to be
    equally well defined with that of the prismatic colours, though the
    proportion of the spectrum may vary in different countries. And, as
    a confusion of ideas would be created, especially when treating of
    the North European Sword, by neglecting this superficial method of
    classification, I shall retain it while proceeding to consider the
    development of the White Arm under their highly conventional limits.</p>

  <p>I must, moreover, remark that the ternary division, besides having no
    absolute chronological signification, and refusing to furnish any but
    comparative dates, is insufficient. Concomitant with, and possibly
    anterior to, the so-called Stone Age, wood, bone, teeth, and horn were
    extensively used; and the use has continued deep into the metal ages.
    Throughout the lower valley of the River of the Amazons, where stone
    is totally wanting, primitive peoples must have armed themselves with
    another material. The hard and heavy trees, both of the Temperates and
    the Tropics, supplied a valuable material which could be treated simply
    by the use of fire, and without metal or even stone. Ramusio speaks
    of a sago-wood (<i>Nibong</i> or <i>Caryota urens</i>) made into short lances
    by the Sumatrans: ‘One end is sharpened and charred in the fire, and
    when thus prepared it will pierce any armour much better than iron
    would do.’<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> The weapon would be fashioned by the patient labour
    of days and weeks, by burying in hot ashes, by steaming and smoking,
    by charring and friction, by scraping with shells and the teeth of
    rodents, and by polishing with a variety of materials: for instance,
    with the rasping and shagreen-like skin of many fishes, notably the
    ray; with rough-coated grasses, and with the leaves of the various
    ‘sandpaper-trees’ which are hispid as a cat’s tongue. And the first
    step in advance would be dressing with silex, obsidian, and other
    cutting stones, and finishing with pumice or with the mushroom-shaped
    corallines. I shall reserve for the next chapter a description of the

  <div class="sidenote"><i>THE ‘BONE AGE.’</i></div>

  <p>Bone, which includes teeth, presented to savage man a hard and
    durable material for improving his coarse wooden weapons. Teledamus
    or Telegonus, son of Circe and founder of Tusculum<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> and Præneste,
    according to tradition slew his father, Ulysses, with a lance-head
    of fish bone—<i>aculeum marinæ belluæ</i>. The teeth of the Squalus and
    other <i>gigantum ossa</i> or megatherian remains supplied points for the
    earliest projectiles, and added piercing power to the blow of the
    club. That a Bone Age may be traced throughout the world,<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> and that
    the phrase a ‘bone- and stone-using people’ is correct, was proved
    by the Weltausstellung of Vienna (1873), whose <span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>splendid collection
    found an able describer in Prof. A. Woldrich.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> The caves of
    venerable Moustier (Département Dordogne), of Belgium, and of Lherm
    (Département Arriège) contributed many jawbones of the cave bear
    (<i>Ursus spelæus</i>); the ascending ramus of the inferior maxilla had been
    cut away to make a convenient grip, and the strong corner-teeth formed
    an implement or an instrument, a tool or a weapon. The caves of Peggau
    in Steiermark (Styria), of Palkau in Moravia, and the Pfahlbauten<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
    or Pile-villages of Olmütz, produced a number of bone articles and
    remnants of the cave bear. These rude implements remind us of the
    weapon used to such good effect by the Biblical Samson, the Hebrew type
    of Hercules, the strong man, the slayer of monsters, and the Sun-god
    (Shamsún).<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

  <p>The wilder tribes of Cambodia convert the bony horn of the
    sword-fish into a spear head, with which they confidently attack the
    rhinoceros.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> At Kotzebue Sound Captain Beechey found lances made
    of a wooden staff ending in a walrus-tooth; and this defence was also
    adapted to a tomahawk-point. The New Guinea tribes tip their arrows
    with the teeth of the saw-fish and the spines of the globe-fish
    (<i>Diodon</i> and <i>Triodon</i>). The horny style of the Malaccan king-crab
    (<i>Limulus</i>), a <span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>Crustacean sometimes reaching two feet in length, is
    also made into an arrow-pile.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> The Australians of King George’s
    Sound arm their spears with the acute barbules of fishes; and the
    natives of S. Salvador, when discovered by Columbus, pointed their
    lances with fish-teeth. The Greenlander’s ‘nuguit’ (fig. 23) is
    mentioned by Crantz as armed with the narwhal’s horn, and the wooden
    handle is carved in relief with two human figures. By its side is
    another spear (fig. 24) with a beam in narwhal-shape, the foreshaft
    being composed of a similar ivory, inserted into the snout so as to
    represent the natural defence. Here we see the association in the
    maker’s mind between the animal from which the weapon is derived and
    the purpose of destruction for which it is chiefly used. It also
    illustrates the well-nigh universal practice amongst savages of
    making their weapons to imitate animate forms. The reason may be a
    superstition which still remains to be explained.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Foreshafts and heads of bone are still applied to the arrows of
    the South African Bushmans. They alternate with wood, chert, and
    metal throughout the North American continent, from Eskimo-land to
    California. A notable resemblance has been traced between the bone-club
    of the Nootka Sound ‘Indians,’ and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>the jade Pattu-Pattu or Meri of New
    Zealand. Hence it has been suspected that this short, flat weapon, oval
    or leaf-shaped, and made to hold in the hand, as if it were a stone
    celt, was originally an imitation of the os humeri. Like the celt,
    also, is the stone club found by Colonel A. Lane Fox in the bed of the
    Bawn river, north Ireland.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

  <p>The long bones of animals, with the walls of marrow-holes obliquely
    cut and exposing the hollow, were fastened upon sticks and poles,
    forming formidable darts and spears. The shape thus suggests the bamboo
    arrow-heads of the North Americans, whose cavity also served to carry
    poison.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> They would, moreover, easily be fashioned by fracture, and
    by friction upon a hard and rough-grained substance, into Swords and
    daggers. The Fenni, or Finns, of Tacitus (‘Germ.’ c. 46), having no
    iron, used bone-pointed arrows. The Innuits, or Eskimos, of Greenland
    and other parts of the outer north, form with the ribs of whales their
    shuttles as well as their Swords. In ‘Flint Chips’ we find that the
    ancient Mexicans had bone-daggers. Wilde<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> gives a unique specimen of
    such a weapon found in the bed of the River Boyne ‘in hard blue clay,
    four feet under sand, along with some stone spear-heads.’ Formed out of
    the leg-bone of one of the large ruminants, it measures ten and a sixth
    inches long, the rough handle being only two and a half inches<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>; the
    blade is smooth, and wrought to a very fine point. This skeyne (the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>Irish ‘scjan’<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>) looks like a little model of a metal cut-and-thrust
    blade (fig. 27). Equally interesting is the knife-blade (fig. 29) found
    with many other specimens of manufactured bone in the Ballinderry
    ‘Crannog’<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> (county Westmeath): the total length is eight inches,
    and the handle is highly decorated. Other bone knives are mentioned in
    the ‘Catalogue’ (pp. 262–63). Bone prepared for making handles, and
    even ferules, for Swords and daggers is also referred to (p. 267):
    the material, being easily worked and tolerably durable, has, indeed,
    never fallen into disuse. In the shape of ivory,<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> walrus-tusk, and
    hippopotamus-tooth it is an article of luxury extensively used in the
    present day for the hafts of weapons and domestic implements. Lastly,
    bone served as a base to carry mere trenchant substances. The museum
    of Professor Sven Nilsson<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> shows (fig. 31) a smooth, sharp-pointed
    splinter, some six inches long, grooved in each side to about a quarter
    of an inch deep. In each of these grooves, fixed by means of cement,
    was a row of sharp-edged and slightly curved bits of flint. A similar
    implement (fig. 30) is represented in the illustrated catalogue of the
    Museum of Copenhagen. Of this contrivance I shall speak at length when
    treating of the wooden Sword.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>‘AGES’ BEFORE THE ‘STONE AGE.’</i></div>

  <p>While bone was extensively used by primitive Man, horn was the
    succedaneum in places where it was plentiful. The Swiss lake-dwellings
    have yielded stag’s horn and wooden hafts or helves, with bored holes
    and sockets; borers, awls or drills; mullers, rubbers, and various
    other instruments. The caverns of the Reindeer period in the south of
    France are not less rich. Stag-horn axes are common in Scandinavia,
    and one preserved by the Stockholm Museum bears the spirited outline
    of a deer. Beads, buttons, and other ornaments are found in England.
    This material, when taken from the old stag, is of greater density
    than osseous matter and of almost stony hardness, as the cancellated
    structure contains carbonate of lime; moreover it was easily worked by
    fire and steam.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>THE ‘HORN-AGE.’</i></div>

  <p>Diodorus (iii. cap. 15) describes the Ichthyophagi as using antelopes’
    horns in their fishing, ‘for need teacheth all things.’ The earliest
    mention of a horn-arm is by Homer (‘Iliad,’ ii. 827, and iv. 105),
    who describes Pandarus, the Lycian, son of Lycaon, using a bow made
    of the six-spans-long<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> spoils of the ‘nimble <span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>mountain-goat.’ The
    weapon may have retained the original form. The early Greek types
    were either simple or composite. The Persians<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> preferred, and till
    lately used, wood and horn, stained, varnished, and adorned as much as
    possible. Duarte Barbosa<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> describes the Turkish bow at Hormuz Island
    as ‘made of buffalo-horn and stiff wood painted with gold and very
    pretty colours.’ The ‘Hornboge’ occurs in the ‘Nibelungenlied,’ and the
    Hungarians appeared in Europe with horn-bows and poisoned arrows.</p>

  <p>The bows of the Sioux and Yutahs are of horn, backed with a strip of
    raw hide to increase the spring. The Blackfoot bow is made from the
    horn of the mountain-sheep (Catlin), and the Shoshone of the Rocky
    Mountains shape it by heating and wetting the horn, which is combined
    with wood (Schoolcraft). The Eskimos of Polar America, where nothing
    but drift-timber is procurable, are compelled to build their weapons
    with several bits of wood, horn, and bone, bent into form by smoking or
    steaming.</p>

  <p>Admirable bows of buffalo-horn—small, but throwing far, and
    strong—are still made in the Indus-valley about Multan. For this
    use the horns are cut, scraped, thinned to increase elasticity;
    joined at the bases by wooden splints, pegs, or nails, and made to
    adhere by glue and sinews. Man would soon learn to sharpen his wooden
    shafts with horn-points, the spoils of his prey. Hence the ancient
    Egyptians applied horn to their light arrows of reed.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> The Christy
    collection contains an arrow from South America (?) armed with a pile
    of deer-horn. The Melville Peninsula, being scant of materials, uses as
    arrow-piles the horns of a musk-ox (<i>ovibos</i>, more <i lang="la">ovis</i> than <i lang="la">bos</i>),
    and the thinned defences of the reindeer strengthened by sinews.
    Antelope-horns are still used as lance-points by the Nubians, the
    Shilluks, and the Denkas of the Upper Nile; by the Jibbus of Central
    Africa, and by the tribes of the southern continent.<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> The ‘Bantu’
    or Kafir races, Zulus and others, make their <i>kiri</i> (kerry) either of
    wood or of rhinoceros-horn. It varies from a foot to a yard long, and
    is capped by a knob as large as a hen’s egg or a man’s fist: hence
    it is called ‘knob-stick’ or ‘throw-stick.’ The Ga-ne-u-ga-o-dus-ha
    (deer-horn war-club) of the Iroquois ended in a point of about four
    inches long; since the people had intercourse with Europeans they have
    learned to substitute metal. The form suggests that the <i>martel-de-fer</i>
    of Persia and India, used by Europe during the fifteenth and sixteenth
    centuries, was derived from a weapon of this kind: suitable points for
    arming it have been found in England and Ireland. The Dublin Museum
    (case 21, Petrie) contains an antler of the red deer converted into
    a thrusting weapon. The Jumbiyah (crooked <span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>dagger) of the Arabs,
    the Khanjar<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> of Persia and India, whence the Iberian Alfânge
    (El-Khanjar) and our silly ‘hanger,’ shows by form and point that it
    was originally the half of a buffalo-horn split longitudinally. The
    modern weapon, with metal blade and ivory handle, has one side of the
    latter flat, betraying its origin by retaining a peculiarity no longer
    required. The same is the case when the whole Jumbiyah is, as often
    happens, made of metal<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> (fig. 6, p. 10).</p>

  <div class="figright col15">

    <div class="caption smcap">Fig. 32.—Harpoon Head.</div>
  </div>

  <p>The sufficiency of horn for the slender wants of uncivilised
    communities was admirably illustrated by the discovery of a Pfahlbau,
    or crannog, some three miles south of Laibach, the capital of Carniola,
    and a little north of the Brunnsdorf village. The site is a low
    mountain-girt basin, formerly a lake or broad of the Lai-cum-Sava
    river, and still flooded after heavy rains. Surface-finds were picked
    up in 1854–55, and regular explorations began in July 1875.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> During
    that year two hundred articles were dug up. The material was chiefly
    stag-horn, tines, and beams, the latter often cut at the burr or
    antler-crown. The chief objects—many of them artistic as those of the
    French ‘Reindeer epoch’—were hatchets, hammers, needles, spindles, and
    punches of horn and split bone; fish-hooks, pincers, and skin-scrapers
    of hog’s tusks; with ornaments set in bone, and teeth bored for
    stringing. Many of these articles showed signs of the saw-kerf or notch
    which had probably been cut with sanded fibre acting like a file.
    There were harpoon-heads of peculiar shape, supposed to be unpierced
    whistles, the hole not having been bored through<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>: evidently they
    were made to ‘unship’ when striking the Welsen (<i>Siluri</i>) of the
    old lake, some of which must have been <span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>six feet long. The wooden
    foreshaft, joined by a string to its head, acted as float, and betrayed
    the position of the prey. This is the third stage of the harpoon:
    the first would be merely a heavy, pointed stick, and the second a
    spear with barbs. There were six horn <i>Dolche</i> (daggers), and one
    peculiar article, an edge of polished stone set in a horn-handle: the
    latter shows at once the abundance of game, and the value and rarity
    of the mineral, which probably belonged only to the rich. The eight
    stone implements were of palæolithic type; the few metal articles—a
    leaf-shaped sword-blade, a rude knife, lance-heads, arrow-piles,
    needles, and bodkins—were chiefly copper, five only being bronze;
    and the pottery corresponds with that of the neolithic period in the
    museums of Copenhagen and Stockholm. Thus the find, like several in
    Switzerland, showed a great preponderance of horns, bones, and teeth
    during a transitional age when the rest of Europe was using polished
    stone and metal.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

  <p>Prehistoric finds are still common in the Laibacher moorground
    (1882). Lauerza, a hamlet on the edge of the swamp, supplied (Nov.
    7) a large stone-axe (<i>Steinbeil</i>), pierced and polished, of the
    quartzose conglomerate common in the adjacent highlands. This article
    was exceptional, most of the stone implements being palæolithic. At
    Aussergoritz appeared remnants of pottery and Roman tiles, a broken
    hairpin of bronze, a spear of Roman type, and a ‘palstab,’<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> also
    of bronze: the latter is the normal chisel-shaped hatchet with the
    flanges turned over for fitting to the handle; it measures 16·5 cent.
    long by 3·5 of diameter at the lower part. The sands of Grosscup also
    yielded sundry fine bronze armlets of Etruscan make found upon embedded
    skeletons. All the finds have been deposited in the Provincial Museum
    at Laibach.</p>

  <p>The use of horn, like that of bone, has survived to the present day,
    and still appears in the handles of knives, daggers, and swords. It is
    of many varieties, and it fetches different prices according to the
    texture, the markings, and other mînutiæ known to the trade.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> ‘Age of Wood’ began early, lasted long, and ended late. As the
    practice of savages shows, the spear was originally a pointed stick
    hardened in the fire; and arrows, the diminutives of the spear, as
    daggers are of the Sword, were tipped with splinters of bamboo, whose
    Tabáshir or silicious bark acted like stone. The Peruvians, even after
    they could beat out plates of gold and silver, fought with pikes having
    no iron tips, but with the points hardened in the fire.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> The same
    was the case with the Australians,<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> who, according to Mr. Howard
    Spensley,<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> also fashioned Swords of very hard wood: the Arabs of
    the Tihámat or Lowlands of Hazramaut (the Biblical Hazramaveth) are
    still compelled by poverty to use spears without metal. I pass over the
    general use of this world-wide material to the epoch when it afforded a
    true Sword.</p>

  <p>The wooden Sword, as we see from its wide dispersion, must have
    arisen spontaneously among the peoples who had reached that stage of
    civilisation where it became necessary.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> These weapons were found
    in the hands of the Indians of Virginia by the well-known Captain John
    Smith. Writing in 1606, Oldfield describes swords of heavy black wood
    in the Sandwich Islands, and Captain Owen Stansley in New Guinea. Mr.
    Consul Hutchinson notes the wooden swords used by the South American
    Itonanamas, a sub-tribe of the Maxos. Those preserved in Ireland and
    others brought from the Samoa Islands will be noticed in a future<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span> page.
    They may mostly be characterised as flat clubs sharpened at the edge,
    and used like our steel blades.</p>

  <p>The shape of the wooden sword greatly varies, and so does its origin.
    Mr. Tylor fell into the mistake, so common in these classifying,
    generalising, and simplifying days, of deriving the sabre, because it
    is a cutting tool, from the axe, and the tuck or rapier from the spear
    because it thrusts. Wooden sword-blades alone have three prototypes,
    viz.:—</p>

  <p>I. The Bulak Museum (Cairo)<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> shows two good specimens of the
    ancient ‘Lisán’ (‘tongue’-weapon) club or curved stick. The first
    battles, says Pliny (vii. 57), were fought by the Africans against
    the Egyptians with clubs which they called <i lang="la">phalangæ</i>. The shorter
    club-sword (1 ft. 11 in.) has a handle ribbed with eighteen fine raised
    rings. The longer or falchion-shaped weapon (2 ft. 5 in.) is hatched
    at the grip with a cross pattern. Both are of hard wood blackened by
    age, and both have the distinct cutting edge. The ancient war-club was
    tipped with metal and whipped with thongs round the handle for firmer
    grasp, like the Roman fasces. The modern Lisán-club, made of tough
    mimosa-wood and about 2½ ft. long, is still used in close combat by the
    Negroid tribes of the Upper Nile. To the Bishárins and Amri the Lisán
    supplies, at dances and on festal occasions, the place of the sword. In
    Abyssinia there is a lighter variety (1 ft. 6 in.) banded alternately
    with red, blue, and green cloth, and protected by a network of brass
    wire. The Ababdeh (modern Æthiopians), content with this, the spear,
    and its pendant the shield, fear not to encounter tribes whose arms are
    the matchlock and a ‘formidable looking, but really inoffensive sword
    with a wondrous huge straight blade.’ These pastoral Nomads are of a
    peculiar and interesting type. The short stature and the well-curved
    and delicate limbs,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span> whose action is quick, lithe, and graceful as the
    leopard’s, connect them with the Bedawin of Arabia; while the knotted
    and spiral locks standing on end, and resembling when tallowed a huge
    cauliflower, affiliate them to the African Somal. Their arms are more
    extensive than their dress, a mere waist cloth, the primitive attire of
    tropical man; and they live by hiring their camels to caravans.</p>

  <p>The Dublin Museum<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> also shows the transitional forms between the
    club and the Sword. The weapon (<i>a</i>) numbered 143 is some twenty-five
    inches long: the second (<i>b</i>) is labelled ‘No. 144, wooden club-shaped
    implement, twenty-seven inches long.’</p>

  <p>The club of the Savage developed itself in other directions to the
    shepherd’s staff, the bishop’s crozier, and the king’s sceptre; hence,
    too, the useless bâton of the field-marshal, and the maces of Mr.
    Speaker and My Lord Mayor. Here we may answer the question why the
    field-marshal should carry a stick instead of a Sword. The unwarlike
    little instrument is simply the symbol of high authority:<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> it is
    the rod, not of the Lictor, but of the Centurion, whose badge of office
    was a vine-sapling wherewith to enforce authority. Hence Lucan (vi.
    146) says of gallant Captain Cassius Scæva who, after many wounds, beat
    off two swordsmen:—</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>THE BOOMERANG.</i></div>

  <p>The form of throwing-stick, which we have taught ourselves to call
    by an Australian name ‘boomerang,’<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> thereby unduly localising an
    almost universal weapon from Eskimo-land to Australia, was evidently
    a precursor of the wooden Sword. It was well known to the ancient
    Egyptians. Wilkinson shows (vol. i. chap. 4) that it was of heavy wood,
    cut flat, and thus offering the least resistance, measuring 1 ft. 3
    in. to 2 ft. long by 1½ in. broad. The shape, however, is not the
    usual segment of a circle, but a shallow <span class="iglyph-0 helv xlarge">S</span>-curve inverted (<span class="iglyph-0 helv xlarge">Ƨ</span>), more bent at the upper end, and straighter in the handle. One
    weapon (p. 236) seems to bear the familiar asp-head.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> The British
    Museum contains a boomerang brought from Thebes by the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>Rev. Greville
    Chester, and a facsimile was exhibited by General Pitt-Rivers.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>
    The end is much curved; the blade has four parallel grooves, and it
    bears the cartouche of Ramses the Great. In no instance have we found
    the round shape and the returning flight of its Australian congener.
    Three illustrations<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> show a large sportsman (the master) bringing
    down birds which rise from a papyrus-swamp, while a smaller figure (the
    slave) in the same canoe holds another weapon at arm’s length.</p>

    weight; but where it strikes it breaks through with extreme impetus,
    and if it be thrown with a skilful hand it returns to him who threw

  </div>

  <p>It has been noted that this peculiarity of reversion or back-flight
    is not generic, even in the true boomerang, but appertains only to
    specific forms. Doubtless it was produced by accident, and, when found
    useful for bringing down birds over rivers or marshes, it was retained
    by choosing branches with a suitable bend. The shapes greatly differ in
    weight and thickness, in curvature and section. Some are of the same
    breadth throughout; others bulge in the centre; while others are flat
    on one side and convex on the other. In most specimens the fore part
    of the lath is slightly ‘dished’: hence the bias causes it to rise in
    the air on the principle of a screw-propeller. The thin edge of the
    weapon is always opposed to the wind, meeting the least resistance. The
    axis of rotation, when parallel to itself, makes the missile <span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>ascend
    as long as the forward movement lasts, by the action of the atmosphere
    on the lower side. When the impulse ceases it falls by the line of
    least resistance, that is, in the direction of the edge which lies
    obliquely towards the thrower. In fact, it acts like a kite with a
    suddenly broken string, dropping for a short distance. But as long as
    the boomerang gyrates, which it does after the forward movement ends,
    it continues to revolve on the same inclined plane by which it ascended
    until it returns to whence it came. This action would also depend upon
    weight; the heavy weapons could not rise high in the air, and must drop
    by mere gravity before coming back to the thrower.</p>

  <p>From Egypt the weapon spread into the heart of Africa. The Abyssinian
    ‘Trombash’ is of hard wood, acute-edged, and about two feet long; the
    end turns sharply at an angle of 30°, but the weapon does not whirl
    back.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>
    The boomerang <span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>of the Nyam-Nyams is called <i>kulbeda</i>. Direct
    derivation is also shown by the curved iron projectile of the Mundo
    tribe on the Upper Nile, a weapon of the same form being represented
    on the old Egyptian monuments. The ‘hunga-munga’ of the negros south
    of Lake Chad, and the adjoining peoples, shows a further development
    of spikes or teeth disposed at different angles, enabling the missile
    to cut on both sides. The varieties of this form, with a profusion of
    quaint ornaments, including lateral blades which answer the purpose
    of wings, and which deal a severer wound, are infinite. Denham and
    Clapperton give an illustration of a Central African weapon forming
    the head and neck of a stork. So the Mpangwe negros<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> of the Gaboon
    River, West Africa, shape their missiles in the form of a bird’s head,
    the triangular aperture (fig. 40, No. 5) representing the eye.</p>

  <p>The throwing-stick has been found in Assyrian monuments: Nemrúd
    strangling the lion holds a boomerang in his right hand. Thence the
    weapon travelled East; and the Sanskrit Ástara, or Scatterer, was
    extensively used by the pre-Aryan tribes of India. The Kolis, oldest
    known inhabitants of Gujarát, call it ‘Katuriyeh,’ a term probably
    derived from ‘Cateia’; the Dravidians of the Madras Presidency know
    it as ‘Collery,’ and the Tamulian Kallar and Marawar (of Madura),
    who use it in deer-hunting, term it ‘Valai Tadi’ (bent stick). The
    Pudukota Rajah always kept a stock in arsenal. The length greatly
    varies, the difference amounting to a cubit or more; and three feet by
    a hand-breadth may be the average. The middle is bent to the extent
    of a cubit; the flat surface with a sharp edge is one hand broad.
    ‘Its three actions are whirling, pulling, and breaking, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span> it is a
    good weapon for charioteers and foot soldiers.’ Prof Oppert, writing
    ‘On the Weapons, &amp;c. of the ancient Hindus’ (1880), tells us that the
    Museum of the Madras Government has two ivory throw-sticks from Tanjore
    and a common wooden one from Pudukota; his own collection contains
    four of black wood and one of iron. All these instruments return,
    as do the true boomerangs, to the thrower. The specimens in the old
    India-House Museum conform with the natural curvature of the wood,
    like the Australian; but, being thicker and heavier, they fall without
    back-flight. Not a few of the boomerangs cut with the inner edge, the
    shapes of the blade and of the grip making them unhandy in the extreme.</p>

  <p>From the throw-stick would naturally arise the Chakrá, the steel wheel
    or war-quoit, which the Akális—a stricter order of Sikhs—carried in
    their long hair, and launched after twirling round the forefinger.<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>
    The boomerang-shape is also perpetuated in the dreaded Kukkri or Gurkha
    Sword-knife, now used, however, only for hand-to-hand fighting. I
    have mentioned the Cuchillo or Spanish clasp-knife- and the Italian
    sickle-throwing. The Australian weapon was unknown, like the shield, to
    Tasmania, whose only missile was the Waddy or throw-stick.</p>

  <p>As the Australian club, swelling at the end, developed itself in one
    direction, to the Malga (war-pick) and hatchet, so on the other line it
    became, by being narrowed, flattened, and curved, the boomerang and the
    boomerang-sword. Finally, the immense variety of curves—some of them
    bending at a right angle—were straightened and made somewhat long-oval
    and leaf-shaped for momentum and impetus.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>THE BOOMERANG-SWORD.</i></div>

  <p>The direct descent of the curved wooden Sword of Egypt from the
    boomerang is shown in many specimens. The blade becomes narrow,
    flat, and more curved; <span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>the handle proves that it is no longer a
    mere missile, and the grip is scored with scratches to secure a
    firmer grasp.<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> The best specimen known to me is in the Bulak
    Museum.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> It is a light weapon of sycomore wood, measuring in
    length 1 mètre 30 cent. (4 ft. 3 in.), in breadth nearly 15 cent. (6
    in.), and in thickness 0·2 cent. (0·78 in.), while the depth of the
    perpendicular connecting the arc with the chord is 10 cent. But what
    makes it remarkable is that the Sword bears at one side the so-called
    ‘Cartouche’<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> of King Ta-a-a (17th dynasty), and at the other end of
    the same side in a parallelogram the name and titles of Prince ‘Touaou,
    the servant of his master in his expeditions.’ This fine specimen was
    found with the mummy and other articles at the Drah Abu’l-Neggah, the
    Theban cemetery.</p>

  <p>The paddle or original oar, mostly used by savages with the face to
    the bow,<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> is of two kinds. The long, pointed spear-like implement
    serves, as a rule, for deeper, and the broad-headed for shallower,
    waters. Both show clearly the transitional state beginning with the
    club and ending with the Sword.</p>

  <p>Mr. J. E. Calder,<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> describing the Catamaran of the swamp tea-tree
    (<i>Melaleuca</i>, sp.) on the southern and western coasts of Tasmania,
    says (p. 23): ‘The mode of its propulsion would shock the professional
    or amateur waterman. Common sticks, with points instead of blades,
    are all that were used to urge it with its living freight through the
    water, and yet I am assured that its progress is not so very slow.’
    Spears were employed in parts of Australia to paddle the light bark
    canoes,<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> and the Nicobar Islanders have an implement combining
    spear and paddle: it is of iron-wood, and of pointed-lozenge shape,
    about five feet in length.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

    captivity.<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> It was a single piece of the hard, heavy, and gummy
    wood which characterises these hot-damp regions,<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> and of different
    shapes with and without handles.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> The most characteristic implement
    is a long and rounded shaft with a tabular, oval, and slightly-pointed
    blade: it was slung by a lanyard round the neck and hung on either
    side. With a weapon of this kind the cannibal natives slaughtered Pero
    Fernandes Sardinha, first Bishop of Bahia, and all his suite; the
    ‘martyrs’ had been wrecked on the shoals of Dom Rodrigo off the mouth
    of the Coruripe River. The scene is illustrated in the ‘History’ of the
    late M. de Varnhagen (p. 321).</p>

  <p>A similar Brazilian instrument was the Macaná, still used on the Rio
    das Amazonas, and there called Tamarana. It retains the form of the
    original paddle, while for offensive purposes the pointed oval head is
    sharpened all round. In parts of the Brazil the Macaná was a rounded
    club; and the sharpened paddle used as a Sword was called Pagaye.<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>
    The Peruvian Macaná and the Callua—the latter compared with a short
    Turkish blade—were made of chonta-wood (<i>Guilielma speciosa</i> and
    <i>Martinezia ciliata</i>) which was hard enough to turn copper tools.<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>
    Mr. W. Bollaert<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> tells us that the ‘Macaná was said by some to be
    shaped <span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>like a long Sword, by others like a club.’ It was both. The
    Tapuyas set these broad-headed weapons with teeth and pointed bones.</p>

  <p>The fine Ethnological Museum of Herr Cesar Godeffroy<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> of Hamburg
    and Samoa, illustrating the ethnology of the Pacific Islands,
    contains many specimens of the knob-stick bevelled on one side of
    the head to an edge and gradually passing into the Sword. On the
    right-hand entrance-wall are, or were, two fine sabres (fig. 53)
    of Eucalyptus-wood, labelled ‘Schwert von Bowen (Queensland).’
    The Sandwich Islanders, we see, still wield the Sword-club with
    sharp-cutting edges, like their neighbours of New Ireland. The savage
    Solomon Archipelago has supplied a two-handed sabre of light and
    bright-yellow wood; its longitudinal mid-rib shows direct derivation
    from the paddle-club. There is also a lozenge-shaped hand-club, which
    may readily have given a model to metal-workers. It is of hard, dark,
    and polished wood, and the handle is whipped round with coir (Tafel xx.
    p. 97): the length is seventy cent. by four of maximum breadth. The
    Swords are unfortunately not figured in the catalogue; but there is a
    fine wooden knife <span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>forty-nine cent. long by six cent. broad, with open
    handle and highly-worked grip (Tafel xxi. p. 135). It comes from Vanna
    Lava, Banks Group, New Hebrides, Polynesia (fig. 55).<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

  <p>The wooden Sword extended deep into the Age of Metal. Articles of the
    kind have been brought from New Zealand, which are evident copies of
    modern European weapons. Wilde (p. 452) gives the wooden Sword, found
    five feet deep in Ballykilmunary near High Park, county Wicklow, with
    some bog-butter, but he finds no indications of its age. The length
    is twenty inches (fig. 56). Upon the side of the blade, and of a
    piece with it, stands a projection whose purpose is unknown: it is
    evidently inconvenient for a toy; but if the relic be a model for a
    sand-mould, the excrescence would have left an aperture by which to
    pour in the metal. This view is supported by the shape of the handle,
    which resembles the grips of the single-piece bronze Swords found in
    different parts of Europe. The Dublin Museum also contains<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> a blade
    apparently intended for thrusting, and labelled ‘Wooden Sword-shaped
    Object.’ The material is oak, blackened by burial in bog-earth: it has
    a mid-rib, a bevelled point, and no appearance of being a model (fig.
    57).</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>THE STONE-SWORD.</i></div>

  <p>Whilst wood was extensively used for Swords, the Age of Stone supplied
    few. The broad and leaf-shaped silex-flakes, dignified by the name
    of Swords, are only daggers and long knives. The fracture of flint
    is uncertain, even when freshly quarried.<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> The workmen would
    easily chip and flake it to form scrapers, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>axes, spear-heads, and
    arrow-piles; but after a certain length, from eight to nine inches,
    the splinters would be heavy, brittle, and unwieldy. Obsidian, like
    silex, would make daggers rather than swords. Such are the stone
    dirk and cutlass in the Kensington Museum. Several European museums
    preserve these flat, leaf-shaped knives of the dark cherty flint found
    in Egypt. The British Museum contains a polished stone knife broken at
    the handle, which bears upon it in hieroglyphics the name of ‘Ptahmes
    (Ptah-son), an officer.’ There is also an Egyptian dagger, of flint
    from the Hay Collection, still mounted in its original wooden handle
    apparently by a central tang, and with remains of its skin sheath.<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>
    The Jews, who borrowed circumcision from the Egyptians, used stone
    knives (<span lang="grc">τὰς μαχαίρας τὰς πετρίνας</span>). Atys, says Ovid, mutilated himself
    with a sharp stone,—</p>

  <p class="noindent">and the Romans sacrificed pigs with flints. Several undated
    poniards in our collections are remarkable: for instance, the English
    daggers of black and white flint, rare in Scotland and unknown in
    Ireland; (<i>a</i>) the Iberian or Spanish blade in the Christy Collection,
    five and a half inches long, and found at Gibraltar; the Tizcuco
    blade of chalcedony, eight inches long (<i>ibid.</i>); (<i>b</i>) the Danish
    dagger in the Copenhagen Museum, thirteen and a half inches long (the
    rounded handle makes it a ‘marvel of workmanship’); and (<i>c</i>) the
    flint hatchet-sabre of the same <span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>collection, fifteen and a half inches
    in length. It is a mystery how the minute and delicate ornamentation,
    the even fluting like ripple marks, on these Danish flint-daggers was
    produced.</p>

  <p>A better substance than flint was found in the compact sandstone
    and in granitic serpentine, so called because that rock resembles a
    snake’s skin. It is easily worked, while it is harder than the common
    serpentine. A dagger or knife found beside a stone cist in Perthshire
    is described as a natural formation of mica-schiste.</p>

  <p>The Stone Age produced nothing more remarkable than the Pattu-Pattu or
    Meri of New Zealand, which an arrested development prevented becoming
    a Sword. Its shape, that of an animal’s blade-bone, suggests its
    primitive material; and New Guinea has an almost similar form, with
    corresponding ornamentation in wood. What assimilates it to the Sword
    is that it is sharp-edged at the top as well as at the side. It is
    used for ‘prodding’ as well as for striking, and the place usually
    chosen for the blow is the head, above the ear, where the skull is
    weakest. Some specimens are of the finest green jade or nephrite,<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>
    a refractory stone which must have been most troublesome to fashion.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>THE SWORD OF WOOD AND STONE.</i></div>

  <p>Wood, however hard and heavy, made a sorry cutting weapon, and stone
    a sorrier Sword; but the union of the two improved both. Hence we may
    divide wooden Swords into the plain and the toothed blades, the latter—</p>

  <p class="noindent">An obvious advance would be to furnish the cutting part with
    the incisors of animals and stone-splinters. In Europe these would
    be agate, chalcedony, and rock-crystal; quartz and quartzite; flint,
    chert, Lydian stone, horn-stone, basalt, lava, and greenstone (or
    diorite); hæmatite, chlorite, gabbro (a tough bluish-green stone),
    true jade (nephrite), jadite, and fibrolite, found in Auvergne. Pinna
    and other shells have been extensively used—for instance, by the
    Andamanese—as arrow-heads and adze-blades.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

  <p>Tenerife, and the so-called New World, preferred the easily-cleft
    green-black obsidian,<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> of which the Ynkas also made their knives.
    The Polynesian Islands show two distinct systems of attachment. In the
    first the fragments, inserted into the grooved side, are either tied or
    made fast by gum or cement. In the second they are set in a row between
    two small slats or strips of wood, which, lastly, are lashed to the
    weapon with fibres. The points are ingeniously arranged in the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>opposite
    direction, so as to give severe cuts both in drawing and withdrawing.
    The Eskimos secure the teeth by pegs of wood and bone. The Pacho of the
    South Sea Islanders is a club studded on the inner side with shark’s
    teeth made fast in the same manner. The Brazilian Tapuyas armed a
    broad-headed club with teeth and bones sharpened at the point.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> In
    ‘Flint Chips’ we find that a North American tribe used for thrusting
    a wooden Sword, three feet long, tipped with mussel-shell. Throughout
    Australia the natives provide their spears with sharp pieces of
    obsidian or crystal: of late years they have applied common glass,<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>
    a new use for waste and broken bottles (fig. 70). The fragments are
    arranged in a row along one side near the point, and are firmly
    cemented. There is no evidence of this flint-setting in Ireland: but
    the frequent recurrence of silex implements adapted for such purpose
    has suggested, as in the Iroquois graves, that the wood which held <span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>them
    together may have perished. We read in ‘Flint Chips’ that the Selden
    Manuscript shows a flake of obsidian mounted in a cleft wooden handle,
    the latter serving as a central support, with a mid-rib running nearly
    the whole length. The sole use of the weapon was for thrusting.<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

  <p>The people of Copan (Yucatan) opposed Hernandez de Chaves with slings,
    bows, and ‘wooden Swords having stone edges.’<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> In the account of
    the expedition sent out (1584) by Raleigh to relieve the colony of
    Virginia, we read of ‘flat, edged truncheons of wood,’ about a yard
    long. In these were inserted points of stag-horn, much in the same
    manner as is now practised, except that European lance-heads have
    taken their place. Knives, Swords, and glaives, edged with sharks’
    teeth,<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> are found in the Marquesas; in Tahiti, Depeyster’s Island,
    Byron’s Isles, the Kingsmill Group, Redact Island,<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> the Sandwich
    Islands, and New Guinea. Captain Graah notices a staff edged with
    shark’s teeth on the cast coast of Greenland, and the same is mentioned
    amongst the Eskimos by the late Dr. King.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

  <p>In the tumuli of Western North America, Mr. Lewis Morgan, the
    ‘historian of the Iroquois,’ mentions that, when opening the ‘burial
    mounds’ of the Far West, rows of flint-flakes occurred lying side by
    side in regular order; they had probably been fastened into sticks or
    swords like the Mexican. Hernandez<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> describes the ‘Mahquahuitl’
    or Aztec war-club as armed on both sides with razor-like teeth of
    ‘Itzli’ (obsidian), stuck into holes along the edge, and fastened with
    a kind of gum. Mr. P. T. Stevens (‘Flint Chips,’ p. 297) says that this
    Mexican broadsword had six or more teeth on either side of the blade.
    Herrera, the historian, mentions, in his ‘Decads,’ ‘Swords made of
    wood having a gutter in the fore part, in which the sharp-edged flints
    were strongly fixed with a sort of bitumen and thread.’<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> In 1530,
    according to contemporary Spanish <span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>historians, Copan was defended by
    30,000 warmen, armed with these and other weapons,<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> especially with
    fire-hardened spears. The same have been represented in the sculptures
    of Yucatan, which imitated the Aztecs. Lord Kingsborough’s ruinous work
    on Mexican antiquities, mostly borrowed from Dupaix, shows a similar
    contrivance (<i>b</i> and <i>c</i>). A Sword having six pieces of obsidian in
    each side of the blade, is to be seen in a museum in Mexico.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> A
    Mexican Sword of the fifteenth century is of iron-wood, twenty-five
    inches long, and armed with ten flakes of black obsidian; and the same
    is the make of another Mexican Sword nearly four feet long.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

  <p>The next step would be to use metal for bone and stone. So the Eskimos
    of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>Davis Strait and some of the Greenlanders show an advance in art by
    jagging the edge with a row of chips of meteoric iron.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> This would
    lead to providing the whole wooden blade with an edge of metal, when
    the latter was still too rare and too expensive for the whole weapon.
    This economy might easily have overlapped not only the Bronze, but the
    Iron Epoch.</p>

  <p>The tooth-shaped edge was perpetuated in the Middle Ages, as we see
    by serrated and pierced blades of Italian daggers. That it is not yet
    extinct the absurd saw-bayonet of later years proves.</p>

  <p class="noindent">The discovery of ore-smelting and metal-working, following that
    of fire-feeding, would enable Man to apply himself, with notably
    increased success, to the improvement of his weapons. But many
    races here stopped short. The Australian, who never invented a bow,
    contenting himself with the boomerang, could not advance beyond the
    curved and ensiform club before he was visited by the sailors of
    the West. His simplicity in the arts has constituted him, with some
    anthropologists, the living example of the primitive and prehistoric
    <i>genus homo</i>.<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> The native of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>New Guinea, another focus of arrested
    civilisation, was found equally ignorant of the metal blade. The
    American aborigines never taught themselves to forge either cutting or
    thrusting Swords; and they entertained a quasi-superstitious horror
    of the ‘long knife’ in the hands of the pale-faced conqueror. This
    is apparently the case with all the lower families of mankind, to
    whom the metal Sword is clean unknown. If the history of arms be the
    history of our kind, and if the missile be the favourite weapon of the
    Savage and the Barbarian, the metal Sword eminently characterises the
    semi-civilised, and the use of gunpowder civilised, man.</p>

  <p>A chief named Shongo, of Nemuro, in Japan, assured Mr. John Milne<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>
    that, ‘in old times, when there were no cutting tools of metal, the
    people made them of Aji, a kind of black stone, or of a hard material
    called ironstone. Even now implements of this material are employed by
    men who dwell far in the interior.’ Here, then, is another instance of
    the stone and the metal ‘Ages’ overlapping, even where the latter has
    produced the perfection of steel-work.</p>

      <span class="subhead">THE PROTO-CHALCITIC OR COPPER AGE OF WEAPONS.</span>
    </h2>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">I will</span> begin by noticing that the present age has settled a question
    which caused much debate, and which puzzled Grote (ii. 142) and
    a host of others half a century ago, before phosphor-bronze was
    invented. This was the art of hardening (not tempering) copper and its
    alloys. All knew that these metals had been used, in cutting the most
    refractory substances,<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> granite, syenite, porphyry, basalt, and
    perhaps diorite,<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> by the ancient Egyptians, Assyrians, Trojans,
    and Peruvians. But none knew the process, and some cut the knot by
    questioning its reality. When you cannot explain, deny—is a rule with
    many scientists. The difficulty was removed by the Uchatius-gun,<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>
    long reported to be of ‘steel-bronze,’<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> but simply of common
    bronze hardened by compression. At the Anthropological Congress of
    Laibach<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> (July 27–29, 1878), Gundaker Graf Wurmbrandt, of Pettau,
    exhibited sundry castings, two spear-heads and a leaf-shaped blade of
    bright bronze (Dowris copper) adorned with spirals to imitate the old
    weapons. They were so indurated by compression that they cut the common
    metal.</p>

  <p>Again, at the Anthropological Congress of Salzburg (August 8, 1881),
    Dr. Otto Tischler, of Prussian Königsberg, repeated the old experiment,
    showing how soft copper and bronze could be hardened by the <i lang="la">opus
    mallei</i> (simple hammering). Moreover his metal thus compressed could
    cut and work the common soft <span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>kinds without the aid of iron or steel.
    He exhibited two bronze plates in which various patterns had been
    punched by bronze dies. The hammering, rolling, beating, and pressing
    of copper for the purpose of hardening are well known to modern, and
    doubtless were to ancient workmen. The degree of compression applied is
    the feature of the discovery, or rather re-discovery.<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

  <p>It may be doubted whether old Egypt and Peru knew our actual process
    of hydraulic pressure, whose simplest form is the waterfall. But they
    applied the force in its most efficient form. The hardest stones
    were grooved to make obelisks; the cuts were filled with wedges of
    kiln-dried wood, generally sycomore; and the latter, when saturated
    with water, split the stone by their expansion. And we can hardly deny
    that a people who could transport masses weighing 887 tons<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> over a
    broken country, from El-Suwan (Assouan) to Thebes, a distance of 130
    miles, would also be capable of effecting mechanical compression to a
    high degree.</p>

  <p>Buffon (‘Hist. Nat.’ article ‘Cuivre’) believed in the ‘lost art.’
    Rossignol<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> (pp. 237–242) has treated of the
    <i>trempe</i> (<span lang="grc">διά τινος βαφῆς</span>) <i lang="fr">que les anciens donnèrent au cuivre</i>; and relates that the
    chemist Geoffrey, employed by the Comte de Caylus, succeeded in
    hardening copper and in giving it the finest edge; but the secret was
    not divulged. Mongez, the Academician, held that copper was indurated
    by immersion and by gradual air-cooling, but that <i lang="fr">la trempe</i> would
    soften it.<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> In 1862 David Wilson, following Proclus and Tzetzes,
    declares the process of hardening and tempering copper so as to give
    it the edge of iron or steel, a ‘lost art.’ Markham<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> supposes
    that the old Peruvians hardened their copper with tin or silica; and
    he erroneously believes that tin is scarcely found in that section of
    South America.</p>

  <p>Modern archæological discovery has suggested that in many parts of the
    world we must intercalate an age of virgin Copper between the so-called
    Stone and Bronze Periods. The first metal, as far as we know, was the
    stream-gold, washed by the Egyptians; and, as Champollion proved, the
    hieroglyphic sign for Núb (gold) is a bowl with a straining-cloth
    dripping water.<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> The fable of glass-discovery by the Sidonians
    on the sands of the Belus,<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> a tale which has <i lang="fr">le charme <span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>des
      origines</i>, explains, I have said, how a bit of metalliferous stone,
    accidentally thrown upon the fire in a savage hut, would suggest one
    of the most progressive of the arts. And soon the ‘featherless biped,’
    like the Mulciber and the Mammon of Milton—</p>

  <p>The greater antiquity of copper in Southern Europe was distinctly
    affirmed, as has been seen, by the Ancients. The use of sheeting, or
    plating, on wood or stone was known as long ago as the days of Hesiod
    (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 880–850?):</p>

  <p>Copper sheets<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> were also used for flooring, as we learn from the
    <span lang="grc">χάλκεος οὐδός</span> (Copper threshold) of Sophocles (‘Œdip. Col.’); and
    the treasury-room of Delphi, as opposed to the λάϊνος οὐδός (stone
    threshold). So in the Palace of Alcinous (‘Odys.’ vii. 75) the walls
    and threshold were copper, the pillars and lintels were silver, and the
    doors and dogs of gold.</p>

  <p>The same practice was continued in the Bronze Period, as Dr. Schliemann
    proved when exploring the Thalamos attached to the Treasury of Minyas
    at Orchomenus. Nebuchadnezzar, in the ‘Standard Inscription,’ declares
    that he plated with copper the folding-doors and the pillars of the
    Babylon rampart, and it is suspected that gold and silver sheeted the
    fourth and seventh stages of the Temple of Belus, <i>vulgò</i> the Tower of

  <p>Even during her most luxurious days Rome, like Hetruria, retained
    in memoriam the use of copper (or bronze?) for the sclepista or
    sacrificial knife. When founding a city they ploughed the pomœrium
    with a share of æs. The Pontifex Maximus and priests of Jupiter used
    hair-shears of the same material, even as the Sabine priests cut their
    locks with knives of æs. The Ancile or sacred shield was also of æs.</p>

  <p>Pope, and other writers of his time, translated copper and bronze by
    ‘brass’ (copper and zinc); and in older English ‘native brass’ was
    opposed to ‘yellow copper’ (<i lang="fr">cuivre jaune</i>). The same occurs in the
    A. V. Tubal Cain (the seventh in descent from Adam) is ‘an instructor
    of every artificer in <em>brass</em> and iron’<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> (Gen. iv. 22). Moses is
    commanded to ‘cast five sockets of <em>brass</em> for pillars’<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> (Exod.
    xxvi. 37). Bezaleel and Aholiab, ‘artists of the tabernacle,’ work in
    <em>brass</em> (Exod. xxxi. 4). We read of a ‘land whose stones are iron,
    and out of whose hills thou mayest dig <em>brass</em>’ (Deut. viii. 9). Job
    tells us, ‘Surely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold
    where they fine it. Iron is taken out of the earth, and <em>brass</em> is
    molten out of the stone.’<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> Hiram of Tyre was ‘cunning to work all
    works in <em>brass</em>’ (casting and hammer-wrought), for Solomon’s Temple,
    which dates from about two centuries after the time of the Trojan war
    (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 1200). In Ezra (viii. 27) the text mentions ‘two vessels
    of fine copper, precious as gold;’ and the margin reads ‘yellow or
    shining <em>brass</em>.’ Nor is the old word quite forgotten: we still speak
    of a ‘<em>brass</em> gun.’</p>

  <p>‘In the <em>Brazen</em> Age,’ unphilosophically says Schlegel (‘Phil. of
    Hist.’ sect. ii.), ‘crime and disorder reached their height: violence
    was the characteristic of the rude and gigantic Titans. Their arms were
    of <em>copper</em>, and their implements and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>utensils <em>brass</em> or bronze.’ I
    should generally translate, with Dr. Schliemann and Mr. Gladstone, the
    Homeric <span lang="grc">χαλκός</span>, ‘copper,’ not bronze, chiefly because the former is
    malleable and is bright, two qualities certainly not possessed by the
    alloy. There are alloys which are malleable,<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> and others (Dowris
    copper) which shine; but this is not the case with common bronze, and
    no poet would note its brilliancy as a characteristic.</p>

  <p>Pure copper, however, would generally be used only in lands where tin
    for bronze, and zinc for brass, were unprocurable: isolated specimens
    may point only to a temporary dearth. Thus, the Copper Age must have
    had distinct areas. M. de Pulsky and M. Cartenhac (‘Matériaux,’ &amp;c.)
    held to a distinct Copper Age between the Neolithic and the Bronze.
    Dr. John Evans considers the fabrication due to want of tin or to
    preference of copper for especial purposes. But the types of copper
    tools, &amp;c., are not transitional.</p>

  <p>The native ore was used in many districts of North America. Celts of
    various shapes from Mhow, Central India, were analysed by Dr. Percy,
    who found no tin in them. Tel Sifr in Southern Babylonia and the island
    of Thermia in the Greek Archipelago supplied similar articles. They are
    also discovered exceptionally in Denmark, Sweden, Austria, and Hungary,
    France, Italy, and Switzerland. I have noticed the use of the unmixed
    metal in the Crannogs of Styria. It seems to have prevailed in Istria:
    at Reppen-Tabor near Trieste, the supposed field of battle with the
    Romans that decided the fate of the Peninsula (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 178), was
    found a fine lance-head of pure copper eight and a half inches long:
    it is now in the Museo Civico. The same was the case with Dalmatia; at
    Spalato and elsewhere I saw axe-heads of unmixed metal. And we have
    lately obtained evidence that old Lusitania, like Ireland,<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> was in
    similar conditions.</p>

  <p>Thus the Age of Copper would be simply provisional in certain
    localities, separating the periods of horn and bone, teeth and wood,
    from that of alloys; even as the latter led, in the due line of
    development, to the general adoption of iron and steel for Swords and
    other weapons. But we have no need for dividing the epochs with the
    perverse subtilties of certain naturalists, who use and abuse every
    pretext for creating new species. If there be any sequence, it would
    be copper, bronze, and brass. In most places, however, the ages were
    synchronous, and some races would retain the use of the pure metal,
    even when tin and zinc lay at their doors.</p>

  <p>The Venus (♀) of alchemy was called in the Semitic tongues <i>nhs</i> or
    <i>nhsh</i>, in Arab <i lang="ar-Latn">nahás</i>, and in Hebrew <i lang="he-Latn">nechosheth</i> (<span lang="he">נחשת</span>). The term
    is popularly derived from a triliteral root signifying a snake, the
    crooked reptile, the serpent that is in the sea (Job xvi. 13; Is.
    xxvii. 1; Amos ix. 3, &amp;c.); either because the metal is poisonous, like
    the Ophidæ, or from its brightness of burnish. Similarly, <i>dhahab</i>
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>(<span lang="he">זהב</span>), gold, was named from its splendour; and silver, also meaning
    money (<i>argentum</i>, argent), was <i>kasaf</i> (<span lang="he">כסף</span>), the pale metal, the
    ‘white gold’ of Egypt. Both <i>nechosheth</i> and <i>nahás</i> apply equally to
    copper, bronze, and brass; hence we must probably read ‘copper Serpent’
    for ‘<em>brazen</em> Serpent,’ and ‘City of Copper’ for ‘City of <em>Brass</em>.’</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>COPPER IN CYPRUS.</i></div>

  <p>There is the same ambiguity in the Greek and the Roman terms. The word
    <span lang="grc">χαλκός</span> (<i lang="grc-Latn">chalcus</i>) is popularly derived from <span lang="grc">χαλάειν</span>, ‘to loose,’
    because easily melted: I should prefer Khal or Khar, ‘Phœnicia,’ whose
    sons introduced it into Greece. The Hellenes dug it in Eubœa, where
    Chalcis-town<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> gave rise to the ‘stone’ <span lang="grc">χαλκῖτις</span> (<i lang="grc-Latn">chalcitis</i>,
    Pliny, xxxiv. 2). They also knew the ore as <span lang="grc">ἡ κύπρος</span>; and when the
    Romans, who annexed Cyprus in <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 57, worked the mines,
    their produce, says Josephus, was called <span lang="grc">χαλκὸς κύπριος</span>. <i lang="grc-Latn">Chalcos</i> is
    essentially ambiguous unless qualified by some epithet, as <span lang="grc">ἔρυθρος</span>
    (red), <span lang="grc">μέλας</span> (black), <span lang="grc">αἴθιοψ</span> (Ethiopian colour = ruddy brown), <span lang="grc">πόλιος</span>
    (iron-grey), and so forth. In fact, like <i lang="la">æs</i>, it is a generic term for
    the so-called ‘base metals’ (iron,<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> copper, tin, lead, and zinc),
    as opposed to the ‘noble metals’—gold and silver, to which we should
    add platinum.</p>

  <p>Worse still, <span lang="grc">χαλκεύς</span> (<i lang="grc-Latn">khalkefs</i>), a copper-smith, was applied to the
    blacksmith,<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> and even to the <i>chrysochoös</i>, or gold-caster, at
    the court of Nestor (‘Od.’ iii. 420, 432); and to <span lang="grc">χαλκεῖα</span> or <span lang="grc">χαλκήϊα</span>,
    smithies in general. The Roman <i>æs</i>, opposed to the <i>cyprium</i> or <i>æs
    cyprium</i><a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> of Pliny (xxxiv. 2, 9), and <i>smaragdus cyprius</i> or
    malachite, is equally misleading unless we render it ‘base metal.’ We
    know not how to translate Varro<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> when he speaks of the cymbals at
    the feast of Rhea: ‘<span lang="la">Cymbalorum sonitus, ferramentorum jactandorum vi
    manuum, et ejus rei crepitus in colendo agro qui fit, significant quod
    ferramenta ea ideo erant ære</span>’ (copper, bronze, brass?), ‘<span lang="la">quod <em>antiqui</em>
    illum colebant ære antequam ferrum esset inventum</span>.’ Here he wisely
    limits the dictum to Greece and Rome.</p>

  <p>According to S. P. Festus (<i>sub voce</i>), ‘<span lang="la">ærosam appellaverunt antiqui
    insulam Cuprum,<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> quod in eâ plurimum æris nascitur</span>.’ We now derive
    the Sacred Island <span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>from ‘Guib’ (pine-tree), ‘er’ (great), and ‘is’
    (island); ‘Guiberis,’ alluding to its staple growth. General Palma (di
    Cesnola<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>) prefers the Semitic ‘kopher’ (<i>Lawsonia inermis</i>), the
    henna-shrub, even as Rhodes took its name from the rose or malvacea;
    and he finds in Stephanus Byzantinus<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> that the plant was then
    abundant. The diggings are alluded to by all the great geographers of
    antiquity, Aristotle (‘de Anim.’ v. 17<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>), Dioscorides (v. 89),
    Strabo (xvi. 6), and Pliny (xii. 60, xxxiv. 20). In Ezekiel (xxvii. 13)
    the trade in copper vessels is attributed to Javan (Ionia), Tubal, and
    Meshech; the latter are the Moschi of Herodotus (vii. 78), a Caucasian
    people who may have originated the ‘Moscows’ or Russians. Agapenor
    and his Arcadians were credited with having introduced copper-mining
    into Neo-Paphos; yet there is no doubt that the Phœnicians had worked
    metal there before the Greek colonisation. Menelaus (‘Od.’ iv. 83–4)
    visits Cyprus for copper; and Athene-Mentor fetches it, as well as
    ‘shining iron’ (steel?), from Temése (Τεμέση, ‘Od.’ i. 154).<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> These
    diggings, together with those of Hamath (Amathus, Palæo-Limassol),
    Soli, Curium, and Crommyon, are mentioned by Palma, who also alludes
    to an ‘unlimited wealth of copper.’ Yet, despite this and the general
    assertion that copper was the most important production of Cyprus, we
    have found only the poorest mines at Soli in the Mesaoria-plain, the
    counterslope of the Pedia. The island, it is true, has been wasted
    and spoiled by three centuries of the ‘unspeakable Turk.’ But the
    researches of late travellers and collectors—and these have been
    exhaustive since the British occupation—have hitherto failed to find
    extensive traces of mining. The rarity, together with the poverty of
    the matrix, would suggest the following explanation.</p>

  <p>Cyprus was probably not so much a centre of production as a depôt of
    trade which collected the contributions of adjacent places—e.g. the
    isle of Siphanos (Sifanto), where copper has been found with iron and
    lead. Such was the general history of islands and archipelagos outlying
    barbarous and dangerous coasts on the direct lines of commerce, various
    sections of the world’s great mercantile zone and highway of transit
    and traffic. The Cassiterides, also, served as storehouses for the
    stream-tin and the chalcopyrite (copper pyrites) of Cornwall and of
    Devonshire, whilst they enjoyed the fame of producing it. During the
    Middle Ages, Hormuz or Ormuz (Armuza), in the Persian Gulf, served, and
    Zanzibar still serves, as a centre of import, export, and exchange, as
    a magazine and as a shipping station for its mainland.</p>

  <p>One of the ores which occurs in the greatest number of places<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> and
    in the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>largest quantities; having a specific gravity ranging from
    8·830 to 8·958; harder and more elastic than silver; the most tenacious
    of metals after iron and platinum; malleable when cold as well as when
    hot, so as not to require the furnace; melting at a temperature between
    the fusion points of silver and gold (1196° F.); and readily cast in
    sand-beds and moulds, Copper must have been used in the earliest ages,
    and has continued to our day, when the art of smelting it—at Swansea,
    for instance, in South Wales—is perhaps more advanced than that of any
    other ore. When the stone-and-bone weaponed peoples began their rude
    metallurgy, they would retain, with similar habits of thought, the same
    principles of design. The old Celtis, Celt, or chisel of serpentine or
    silex, would be copied in the newly-introduced and gradually-adopted
    weapon-tool of metal; and the transition would be so gradual that we
    trace without difficulty the process of development. The first metal
    blade was probably a dagger of copper, preserving the older shape of
    wood, horn, and stone: possibly it resembled the copper knife found at
    Memphis in 1851 by Hekekyan Bey; and this afterwards would grow to a
    Sword. Wood, stone, copper, and bronze, iron and steel, must long have
    been used simultaneously, slowly making way for one another, as the
    musket took the place of the matchlock, the rifle of the musket.</p>

  <p>According to Pliny (vii. 57), ‘Aristotle supposes that Scythes,
    the Lydian, was the first to fuse and temper copper; while
    Theophrastus,<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> in Aristotle’s day, ascribes the art to Delas,
    the Phrygian. Some give the origin to the Chalybes, others to the
    Cyclopes.’ Achilles, the pupil of Chiron (ibid. v. 20), is represented
    in pictures as scraping the <i lang="la">ærugo</i><a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> or verdigris off a spear
    into the wound of Telephus, the effect of which diacetate would soon
    be followed by the discovery of blue-stone (sulphate of copper, blue
    copperas) or blue vitriol, still a favourite in the East. Pausanias
    (‘Æliaca’) further informs us that Spanish copper, or copper from
    Tartessus, was the first used. The classics agree that Cadmus (not
    ‘the foreigner,’ but the ‘old man,’ <i>El-Kadim</i>, or the ‘Eastern man,’
    <i>El-Kadmi</i>) introduced metallurgy into Greece.</p>

  <p>We have ample evidence of extensive working and use of copper, called
    ‘Khomet,’ by the peoples of the Nile Valley. The ore occurs in the Wady
    Hammámát, the Egyptian Desert, and the so-called ‘Sinaitic’ Peninsula.
    As the Pyramids are the oldest of buildings, so the works in Wady
    Magharah (Valley of Caves) are perhaps the most ancient mines in the
    world.<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>
    They were first opened (circ. <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 3700–3600) <span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>by
    the eighth king of the Third Dynasty, the Sephouris of Manetho, the

  <p>The diggings were not abandoned till the days of Amenemhat, of the
    Twelfth Dynasty, when the labourers were removed to Sarábit-el-Khádim,
    the ‘Men-hirs’ (not heights) of the Servant in the Wady Nasb or Valley
    of Sacrificial Stone. Here gangs of miners, guarded by a strong force,
    extracted (as the slag-heaps show) Mafka or Mefka<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> (copper?

    the Isis of pure light, who presided over the Mafka-land, and who was
    the ‘goddess of copper,’ are mentioned in a tablet. Other hieroglyphs
    contain the names and titles of the rulers, and fragments of vases

    rock-sunk moulds for running the metal <span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>into ingots, Sarábit-el-Khádim

    1150. Agatharchides (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 100) reports that chisels of chalcos
    (<span lang="grc">λατομίδες χαλκαῖ</span>) were found buried in the ancient gold mines of
    Egypt, and hence he deduces that the use of iron was unknown.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>COPPER IN AFRICA AND ASIA.</i></div>

  <p>From Kemi or <span lang="grc">Χημία</span>, ‘black-earth land,’ <i>alias</i> Egypt, the art of
    metallurgy doubtless extended southwards into the heart of Africa.
    Hence travellers wonder when they see admirable and artistic
    blacksmiths amongst races whose sole idea of a house is a round hut
    of wattle and dab. The only coppers in South Africa with which I am
    familiar are those of Katanga in the Cazembe’s country,<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> where the
    Portuguese have long traded. Captain Cameron<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> was shown a calabash
    full of nuggets found when clearing a water-hole. In Uguhha he procured
    a ‘Handa’ from Urua, a Saint Andrew’s cross with central ribs to the
    arms, measuring diagonally fifteen to sixteen inches by two inches wide
    and half an inch thick: the weight was two and a half to three pounds.
    The people prefer this ‘red copper’ to the ‘white copper,’ as they call
    gold. In the Pantheon of Yoruban Abeokuta, ‘Ogun,’ the local Vulcan and
    Wayland Smith, god of metal-workers and armourers, is symbolised by a
    dwarf spear of copper or iron, and human sacrifices are, or were, made
    to it. Barth (vol. iii.) notes the copper (ja-n-Karfi) in El-Hofrah
    (‘the Diggings’) of Waday, south of Dar-For; and in the Kano, the
    Runga, and the Bute countries. Copper wire is worn by the women of the
    hill-lands of Gurma, but it is supposed to be brought from Ashanti (?).
    Africa, however, is as yet unexplored as regards its mineral wealth,
    and we are only beginning to work our old-world California—the Gold
    Coast. Farther south the highly-important copper-mines of Pemba, now
    Bemba, and other parts of the inner Congo and Benguella regions,
    were discovered by the Capitão-Mór, Balthazar Rebello de Aragão, in
    1621–23.<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> Still more to the south, Namaqua-land supplies chalcitic
    ores, a native carbonate, reduced with cow-chips.</p>

  <p>In Asia mines were worked by the ancient Assyrians for copper as
    well as lead and iron, and the former was applied to their weapons,
    tools, and ornaments.<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> The Kurds and Chaldæans still extract from
    the Tiyari heights about Lizan and the valley of Berwari various
    minerals—copper, lead, and iron; silver, and perhaps gold. Upon the
    Steppes of Tartary, and in the wildest parts of Siberia, the remains of
    old copper-furnaces, small and of rude construction, are met with. The
    Digaru Mishmís of Assam have copper-headed arrows.</p>

  <p>The Chinese declare that in olden times men used the metal for arms,
    which in the days of the Thsin (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 300) began to be made of
    iron. Sir John Davis (i. 230) <span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>confirms the fact that the Chinese Sword
    and backsword, both wretched weapons, were originally of copper, long
    ago changed to iron. Dr. Pfizmaier tells us that about <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
    475 the King of U sent a steel blade to his minister, U-tse-tsui,
    wherewith to behead himself. According to Pliny, the Seres exported
    iron to Europe together with their tissues and their skins. The
    Chinese distinguish between Thse-thung (purple copper) and Thing-sung
    (green copper) or bronze. They prefer the ‘Tze-lae,’ or natural ore,
    gathered in the torrent-beds of Kwei-chow and Yun-nan, and the latter
    exclusively produces the famous Pe-tung,<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> or white copper, which
    takes a fine polish like silver. They made copper the base of their
    coinage as well as their weapons. Amongst their many charms and
    talismans are the ‘money-swords,’ a number of ancient copper coins
    pierced with a square central hole, and connected by a metal bar shaped
    like a cross-hilted Sword. These are suspended over the testerns of
    beds and sleeping-couches, that the guardianship of the kings in whose
    reigns the money was issued may keep away ghosts and spirits.</p>

  <p>The Japanese copper<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> is of the finest quality, and is used as a
    standard of comparison. The superiority of the metal, which contains
    a percentage of gold, enabled the self-taught native workmen to
    produce those castings which are the admiration and the despair of
    the European artist. The copper delivered at Nagasaki and Kwashi is
    from Beshki, Akita, and Nambu; other places produce the more ordinary
    kinds. The rich red surface is due to a thin and tenaciously adhering
    film of dioxide: this has been imitated in England. The famous Satzuma
    copper, held to be the best in the world, was prepared under Government
    officials, none being sold privately. The ore was roasted in kilns
    for ten to twenty days, smelted in large furnaces with charcoal, and
    cast in water to make the well-known Japanese ingots. These were bars
    measuring about half an inch on the side, by seven to nine inches in
    length, and weighing some ten taels, nearly equal to one pound. They
    were packed in boxes each weighing a picul (= 125 to 133⅓ lbs. avoir.),
    about the load of a man. The price of course greatly varied. The trade
    was at first wholly in the hands of the Hollanders, who made a good
    thing of their monopoly. There was also an old traffic in Japanese
    copper on the eastern coast of India, especially Coromandel. The
    opening of the empire has caused revolutionary changes.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>THE COPPER AGE.</i></div>

  <p>Copper was abundantly produced in Europe, and the pure metal was used
    throughout the continent with the exception of Scandinavia, where
    specimens are exceedingly rare. The iron age of Denmark begins with
    the Christian era, and was preceded only by bronze and stone. We know
    nothing of the discovery of copper in Ireland. It is supposed in legend
    to have been introduced by the Fir-bolgs (bag-men, Belgæ?), or by the
    Tuatha (gens) de Danaan (the Danes?). <span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>These oft-quoted races, known
    to us only by name, have been affiliated with a host of continentals,
    even with the Greeks.<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> It would be mere guess-work to consider the
    Irish style of treating the ores—by spalling or breaking the stone,
    by wasting, fluxing, or smelting. We have, however, many specimens
    which explain the casting. The metal was called by the natives Uma or
    Umha, a Keltic word; also Dearg Umha, red copper, opposed to Ban<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>
    Umha (white copper) or tin; and this term afterwards became ‘stan,’
    evidently from stannum (Gall. Estain). There are still traditions of
    copper mines having existed at an early period; and, among the wonders
    related by Nonnius (Archæol. Soc. Ireland), we find Loch Lein, now
    Killarney, surrounded by four circles of copper, tin, lead, and iron.
    Of late years ‘miners’ hammers,’ the native name for stone pounders,
    have been dug up in the neighbourhood of that lake, in Northern
    Antrim, at an ancient mine in Ballycastle, and in sundry parts of
    Southern Ireland.<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> The metal occurs in small quantities at Bonmahon
    (Waterford); copper and cobalt at Mucross, and grey copper ore in Cork,
    Kerry, Tipperary, and Galway. In 1855 some 1157 tons were shipped to
    Swansea.</p>

  <p>The Greenlanders and Eskimos cut and hammer their pure native copper,
    without smelting, into nails, arrow-piles, and other tools and weapons.
    Mackenzie (second voyage) tells us that pure copper was common among
    the tribes on the borders of the Arctic Sea, whose arrow-heads and
    spear-heads were cold-wrought with the hammer. Columbus (fourth
    voyage), before touching the mainland of Honduras, saw at Guanaga
    Island a canoe from Yucatan<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> laden with goods, amongst which he
    specifics ‘copper hatchets, and other elaborate articles, cast and
    soldered; forges, and crucibles.’<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> At Hayti the great Admiral
    (first expedition) had mentioned masses of native copper weighing six
    arrobas (quarters).<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> When the Spaniards first entered the province
    of Tupan they mistook the bright copper axes for gold of low touch,
    and bought with beads some six hundred in two days:<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> Bernal Dias
    describes these articles as being very highly polished, with the handle
    curiously carved, as if to serve equally for an ornament and for the
    field of battle.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>COPPER IN AMERICA.</i></div>

  <p>In North America there are two great copper regions which supplied
    the whole continent<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a>—Lake Superior and the lower Rio Grande. The
    former shows the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>first transitional steps from stone to metal. The
    ore occurs in the igneous and trappean rocks that wall in the vast
    fresh-water sea, and is found in solid blocks: one, fifty feet long,
    six feet deep, and six feet in average thickness, was estimated to
    weigh eighty tons. At Copper Harbour, Kawunam Point, a single vein
    yielded forty thousand pounds. The largest mass in the Minnesota Mine
    (Feb. 1857) occupied Mr. Petherick and forty men for twelve months: it
    was forty-five feet long, thirty-two feet broad (max.), and eight feet
    thick; containing over forty per cent. ore, and weighing four hundred
    and twenty to five hundred tons. Malleable and ductile, representing an
    average of 3·10 per cent. native silver, and with a specific gravity
    of 8·78 to 8·96, it required no crucible but Nature’s; it wanted
    only beating into shape, and it needed nothing of the skilled labour
    necessary for the ores of Cornwall and Devon, which contributed so
    largely to the wealth of Tyre. The workings are supposed to belong to
    the race conveniently called ‘Mound-builders,’ and to date from our
    second century, when the Damnonians of Cornwall were in a similar state
    of civilisation. ‘Cliff Mine’ supplied fine specimens of weapons and
    tools, arrow-piles and spear-heads, knives and three-sided blades like
    the old bayonet. The socket was formed by hammering flat the lower
    end, and by turning it over partially (without overlapping) at each
    side, so as to make a flange. Professor James D. Butler (‘Prehistoric
    Wisconsin’) facsimiles twenty-four copper implements. The ‘Indians’
    called the metal Miskopewalik (red iron), opposed to black iron. As
    is also proved by the Brockville relics, the people had the art of
    hardening copper.</p>

  <p>The mines of the lower Rio Grande supplied Mexico with materials for
    arms and tools. According to Captain R. H. Bonnycastle,<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> the
    metal was found in New Mexico and in the volcanic rocks of Mechoacan
    (Valladolid, New Spain). Mexico, like Peru, used the crucible and added
    bronze to copper. The metals were under the god Quetzalcoatl, an Aztec
    Tubal Cain-ben-Lamech.</p>

  <p>Another great centre of the Copper Age was the land ‘where men got gold
    as they do iron out of Biscay.’ The Peruvian army, a host of three
    hundred thousand levied from a total population of twenty millions,
    was armed with bows and arrows, clubs, pikes, javelins, war-axes (of
    stone and copper), and the paddle-sword;<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a>
    while <span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>the people of
    Anahuac (Mexico) had bows and spears, clubs and axes, knives and Swords
    one-handed and two-handed, the Mahquahuitl set with obsidian teeth.
    In the former country the pre-Ynkarial Aymaras, who dug for gold and
    silver, copper and tin, and who employed alloys, almost ignored for
    their ‘Ayri’ (cutting implements) the use of iron and steel, which they
    called Quella (Khellay). The Andes range is popularly derived from
    the Quichua word Anta<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> (copper): the native ore occurred in the
    parts above the cultivation-line, and it abounded in the cupriferous
    sandstones of Bolivian Corocoro. The Huaunanchuco country (Rivero and
    Tschudi, p. 203),<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> conquered by the ninth Ynka, produced a fine
    collection of stone and copper axes, chisels, pins, and tweezers. Blas
    Valera, one of the earliest writers, still often quoted, tells us that
    ‘Anta’ served in place of iron, and that the people worked it more than
    other ores, preferring it to gold (<i>Khori</i>) and silver.<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> Of it were
    made their knives, carpenters’ tools, women’s dress-pins (<i>Tupies</i>),
    polished mirrors, and ‘all their rakes and hammers.’ Garcilasso de
    la Vega adds: ‘pikes, clubs, halberts, and pole-axes,<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> made of
    silver, copper, and some of gold, the “tears of the sun,” having sharp
    points, and some hardened by the fire’; also carpenters’ axes; adzes
    and hatchets; bill-hooks of copper, and blow-pipes of the same metal
    about a yard long applied to earthen or clay pots which they carried
    from place to place. A nugget or loose pebble acted as bell-clapper,
    and copper statuettes were coated or plated with precious metals. The
    ‘Royal Commentaries of the Yncas’ tells us
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>that copper served in
    place of iron for making weapons of war: the people valued it highly
    because more useful than gold and silver; the demand was greater than
    for any other metal, and it paid tribute (vol. i. pp. 25, 43, 48).
    We find notices of copper hammers, bellows-nozzles, adzes, axes, and
    bill-hooks (i. p. 102). Cieza de Leon (chap. lxiii.) tells us that the
    Peruvians placed a piece of gold, silver, or copper in the corpse’s
    mouth. He mentions vases of copper and of stone (chap. civ.), and small
    furnaces of clay where they laid the charcoal and blew the fire with
    thin canes instead of bellows (ibid.). The Introduction (p. lii) notes
    the Peruvian use of copper-trowels for smoothing and polishing walls,
    and a ‘terrible weapon of copper in the shape of a star.’ According to
    Rivero and Tschudi (chap. ix.) the Peruvians could not work copper as
    well as gold or silver; yet they made idols, vases, solid staves a yard
    long with serpents inlaid, and sceptre-heads decorated with condor-like
    birds. The household <i>vaisselle</i> of the Ynkas consisted of gold and
    silver, copper and stone. Rivero, analysing Peruvian weapons and tools
    (hatchets and chisels), found from five to ten per cent. silica: he
    could not determine whether it was an artificial or an accidental
    impurity. Tschudi (1841) discovered copper arms in a tomb three leagues
    from Huaco, and established the fact that the Peruvians used the
    paddle-sword and the scymitar.<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> A copper axe, found in a Huaca (old

  <p>The people of New Granada, according to the tale of Bollaert,<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>
    ‘gilt’ their copper by ‘rubbing the juice of a plant on it and then
    putting it into the fire, when it took the gold colour’—a process
    which reminds us of Pliny’s ox-gall varnish. Ecuador forged copper
    nippers for tweezers. The Chitchas, or Muiscas (i.e. men), of Bogota,
    who knew only gold and ignored copper, tin, lead, and iron, made their
    weapons and tools of hard wood and stone. Thomas Ewbank,<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> of New
    York, catalogues as breast-plates two laminæ of copper and one of
    bronze, the latter being notably the lighter. Out of sundry ‘bronzes’
    from Peru he found four of pure copper. Chile had abundant mines of
    copper, and her metal is held to be the toughest: a bar three-eighths
    of an inch thick will bend backwards and forwards forty-eight times
    before breaking. Her chief centres are Copiapo (i.e. ‘turquoise’),
    Huasco, Coquimbo, Aconcágua and Caléo. The Couche range at Guatacondo,
    in sight of the desert of Atacama, which gave a name to Atacamite
    (submuriate of copper), is said to supply from the same vein gold,
    silver, copper, and coquimbite or white copperas called Pampua
    (packfong?).<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> Gillis (Plate viii. 12, 3) described, amongst the

    axe, weighing about three and a quarter pounds: he doubts, however,
    that the ancient Chilians worked in that metal. The wild Araucanians
    called gold ‘copper’ (Bollaert, p. 184). According to Molina, the
    Puelche tribe extracted from the mines of Payen a copper containing
    half its weight (?) in gold; and the same natural alloy was found in
    the Curico mines.</p>

    fashioning colossal statues. Dr. John Forbes, of Edinburgh,<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> had
    a large chisel of pure copper, showing marks of use, found with a
    wooden mallet in an Egyptian tomb. A flat piece of copper, apparently a
    knife-blade, was turned up when boring thirteen feet below the surface
    where stands the statue of Ramses II. (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 1400).<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> The
    Abbé Barthélemy proved, to the satisfaction of P. J. Rossignol, that
    the arms of the Greeks were first of copper; that iron was introduced

    and that after this time ‘Athor-Venus’ was no more in use. Ulysses

    for offence and defence. As amongst the Philistines, Phœnicians, and
    Carthaginians, whose relics have been found in the Cannæ Plain, the
    metal was at first pure. The ‘bow of steel’ (Job xx. 24, Ps. xviii.
    34) should be rendered ‘bow of copper,’ either copper-plated or (more
    probably) so tempered as to be elastic. Goliah of Gath (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span>

    a spear with an iron head, and a scale-coat<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> of copper: the

  <div class="sidenote">COPPER IN EUROPE.</div>

  <p>Mr. John Latham declares:<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> ‘Copper is a metal of which, in its
    unalloyed state, no relics have been found throughout England. Stone
    and bone first, then bronze or copper and tin combined, but no copper
    alone. I cannot get over this hiatus, cannot imagine a metallurgic
    industry beginning with the use of alloys.’ But this is a negative
    argument. The simple mineral would soon disappear to make bronze, and
    we have some pure specimens. Sir David Brewster<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> describes a large
    battle-axe of pure copper found on the blue clay, twenty feet deep
    below the Ratho Bog. Philips<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> gives the analysis of eight so-called
    ‘bronzes,’ including three Swords, one from the Thames and two from
    Ireland: the spear-head was of impure but unalloyed copper, 99·71 to
    0·28 sulphur. Dr. Daniel Wilson<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> analysed <span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>in 1850 seven British
    ‘bronzes,’ and found one Scottish axe-head, rudely sand-cast, of almost
    pure copper, the natural alloy of gold and silver not reaching to one
    per cent. Moreover, the Romans certainly smelted copper in England,
    where lumps of pure metal, more or less rounded, have been found, but
    always in association with bronze articles. Pennant describes a relic
    discovered at Caerhun (or Caerhen), the old Conovium, near Conway and
    Llandudno, which still works copper: it was shaped like a cake of
    beeswax, measuring eleven inches by three and three-quarter inches in
    thickness; it weighed forty-two pounds, and the upper surface bore
    in deep impression, ‘Socio Romæ’ (to the partner at Rome). Obliquely
    across the legend ran in smaller letters, ‘Natsoc.’ It had evidently
    been smelted upon the spot. In later days our country imported her
    copper from Sweden and Hungary: this appears in the specification of
    patent to George Danby, Jan. 21, 1636. Calamine was shipped as ballast.
    Our great works began during the last century and culminated in Swansea.</p>

      the Palstave celt the loop is usually placed beneath the stock, and
      in the socketed ones it is always close to the top. The cut, drawn
      one-third of the actual size, represents the usual position of the
      loop. The lunette cutting edge, with marked recurved points, presents
      the appearance of having been ground.<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> These implements were cast
      in moulds of bronze, examples of which have been brought to light at
      various times. The third illustration represents the upper part of
      one of these celt moulds and the method of casting: they were for a
      long time a source of confusion to the discoverers, although Colonel
      Vallancy assigns them to their true use.</div>
  </div>

  <p>Wilde (p. 490) expresses the general opinion when he asserts that ‘the
    use of copper invariably preceded that of bronze.’ He well explains
    by two reasons why so few antique implements of pure copper have been
    found in Ireland: either a very short period elapsed between the
    discovery of treating the pure ores and the introduction of bronze;
    or the articles, once common, were recast and converted into the more
    valuable mixed metal. The latter cause is made probable by the early
    intercourse with Cornwall, one of the great tin emporia. ‘Tin-stone’
    (native peroxide of tin or stannic acid) is produced in small
    quantities by Ireland, and Dr. Charles Smith<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> declares that he
    collected it.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span></p>

  <p>Wilde also notices, in the Royal Irish Academy, weapons, tools, and
    ornaments of red metal or pure copper. These are thirty celts of the
    greatest simplicity and the earliest pattern, rudely formed tools, a
    few fibulæ, a trumpet, two battle-axes, and several Sword-blades of the
    short, broad, and curved shape usually called scythes.</p>

    <div class="caption smcap">Fig. 77.—Copper Celts in the Dublin Collection.</div>
  </div>

  <p>The pure copper celts, formed upon two or three types, are the oldest
    in the Dublin collection, and were probably the immediate successors
    of the stone implement. As a rule they have one side smoother than
    the other, as if they had been run into simple stone moulds; they are
    also thicker and of rougher surface than the bronze article. For the
    most part they are rude and unornamented wedges of cast metal: a few
    are lunette-shaped and semilunar blades. The cleansed specimens show a
    great variety of colour. When first found, the brown crust, peculiar
    to the oxidised metal, readily distinguishes them from the bronze
    patina, the beautiful varnish of æruginous or verdigris hue, artificial
    malachite resembling in colour the true native carbonate of copper.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>COPPER SWORDS.</i></div>

  <p>The broad scythe-shaped Swords, numbering forty-one, are supposed to
    be ‘specially and peculiarly Irish.’ The straight blades are shown by
    their large burrs, holes, and rivets either to end in massive handles
    of metal, or to be attached to wooden staves, long or short. Of this
    kind some are curved. As many are of ‘red bronze’ (pure copper),
    darkened by oxidation, it is probable that they are of great antiquity,
    like the celts of that period. Although in some cases the points have
    been broken off, yet the edges are neither hacked, indented, nor worn;
    hence the conclusion that they were true stabbing Swords. Yet Mr.
    John Evans declares that he knows no such thing as a copper Sword.
    In this matter he partially follows Lévesque de la Ravalière, who
    declared copper arms unknown to the Greeks<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> and Romans, Gauls and
    Franks: this savant was refuted and charged with unfairly treating his
    authorities by the Comte de Caylus in a description of seven copper
    Swords dug up (1751) at Gensal in the Bourbonnais. The Abbé Barthélemy
    attributed seven copper blades to the Franks in the reign of Childeric.</p>

  <p>We have ample evidence that ‘copper’ is ambiguously used by modern
    travellers. The modern discoverer of Troy<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> gives us, in his last
    and revised volume, a full account of exploring fifty-three feet
    deep of débris and laying bare the stratified ruins of seven cities,
    including that of the ‘ground floor’ and the Macedonian ruins. The two
    lowest bear witness to a copper age anterior to bronze, whilst they
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>yielded the only gilded object, a copper knife, and the most advanced
    art in specimens of hand-made pottery.<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> The second from below was
    walled, and the third, the most important, was the Burnt City, the
    city of the golden treasures, identified with Ilios. The explorer
    claims to have reduced the Homeric Ilium to its true proportions.
    The grand characteristic in his finds is the paucity of iron, which
    appeared only in the shape of oxidised ‘sling-bullets’: tin is also
    absent. Both these metals, it is true, oxidise most readily; yet, had
    the objects been numerous, they would have left signs, in rust and
    stains. From ‘Troy’ we learn (p. 22) that ‘all the copper articles met
    with are of pure copper, without the admixture of any other metal’:
    the author also finds that ‘implements of pure copper were employed
    contemporaneously with enormous quantities of stone weapons and
    implements.’ He will not admit (‘Troy,’ p. 82) that he has reached the
    bronze period when he discovers in the ‘Trojan stratum,’ at a depth of
    thirty-three to forty-six and fifty-two feet, nails, knives, lances,
    and ‘elegantly-worked battle-axes of pure copper.’<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> And we can
    accept the copper, for much of it was analysed by Professor Landerer,
    of Athens, ‘a chemist well known through his discoveries and writings.’
    He examined the fragments found in the ‘Treasury of Priam,’ and made
    all of them to consist of pure copper, without any admixture of tin or
    zinc (‘Troy,’ p. 340). When treating of the Bronze Age, I shall show
    that alloys were not wanting.</p>

    that of others and to their commixture. Moreover, when casting and

    smelt, and when melted thick, sluggish, and pasty, would not readily
    run without some mixture into all the sinuosities of the mould. In

    metallurgy, making it resemble in this point Creation, articulate

    the <span lang="grc">θεολογούμενα</span> (subjects of a theological nature) alluded to by
    Strabo (x. 3, § 7). It is the old hypothesis of supernatural agency
    in purely natural matters, a kind of luxus-wonder, as the Germans
    call useless miracles, which had waxed stale, even in the days of
    Horace—‘parcus Deorum cultor et infrequens.’ He considers the Curetes
    and Corybantes, the Cabiri (Kabeiroi) of Lemnos and Imbros, and the
    Idæi Dactyli of Crete, the Telchines of Rhodes, and the Sinties, Sinti,
    or Saii of Thrace (Strabo, xii. 3, § 20) as metallurgic <span lang="grc">δαίμονες</span>, or
    genii prisoned in human form, and typifying the successive steps of
    the art. In these days we hardly admit the <i>intersit</i> of a deity when
    human nature suffices to loose the knot; nor do we believe that our
    kind began by worshipping types. Man has always worshipped one thing,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>himself, and himself only, either in the flesh or in the ghost—that
    is, in the non-flesh or the objective nothing—till he arrived at the
    transcendental Man, the superlative, the ideal of Himself.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>THE GOD-SMITHS.</i></div>

  <p>How little of fact is known about the mysterious tribes above mentioned
    becomes evident by a glance at the classics. All six are supposed to be
    Asiatics, worshippers of Rhea (the earth), the great mother of the gods
    and queen of the metal workers. Yet Strabo explains Curetes from Greek
    terms <span lang="grc">κόροι</span> (boys), <span lang="grc">κόραι</span> (girls), κουρά (tonsure), and <span lang="grc">κουροτροφεῖν</span>
    (to bring up the Boy, i.e. Jupiter). Similarly their brethren, the nine
    Corybantes, were termed from their dancing gait and negro-like butting
    with the head, <span lang="grc">κορύπτοντας</span>. They inhabited Samothrace (Samothracia
    alta): this venerable and holy island, in hoar antiquity a general
    rendezvous of freemasonry, or rather of free-smithery, forms a triangle
    with metallic Thasos and with volcanic Lemnos.</p>

  <p>The three or four Cabiri<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> bear a Semitic name, Kabir = the great or
    the old. They seem at first to have represented Ptah-Sokar-Osiris,<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>
    and Herodotus (iii. 37) mentions their temple at Memphis. They became
    in Phœnicia the earliest boatmen or primordial shipbuilders, identified
    by some with the Sesennu or Egyptian Octonary; by others with the seven
    planets or the stars of Typho, our Great Bear;<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> and by others,
    again, with the seven Khnemu (gnomes) or pygmy-sons who waited upon
    their father Ptah-Vulcan. They inhabited Lemnos, where Hephæstus, when
    expelled, like Adam, from the lowest heaven, took refuge among the
    Pelasgi (Diod. Sic. lib. v.): hence the latter preserved their worship.
    Damascius (‘Life of Isidorus’) says: ‘The Asclepius of Berytus is
    neither Greek nor Egyptian, but of Phœnician origin; for (seven) sons
    were born to Sadyk, called Dioscuri and Cabiri, and the eighth of them
    was Esman (i.e. Octavius, No. 8), who is interpreted Asclepius.’<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>

  <p>The Idæan Dactyli (fingers or toes) who occupied ‘fountful Ide’<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a>
    consisted of five brothers, representing the <i lang="la">dextra</i> or lucky hand
    (science, art), and five sisters for the <i lang="la">sinistra</i> or unlucky
    (witchcraft, ill omens). The names of these ‘hands’ (iron-workers) were
    Kelmis (fire or heat = the smelter), Damnameneus (the hammer, or who
    governs by strength, Thor), Hercules (force, animal or mental), and
    Akmon (the anvil or passive principle). Hence Pyracmon the Cyclop, one

    (plunderers) from <span lang="grc">τὸ σίνεσθαι</span> (to pill), who, according to Hellenicus
    of Lesbos (nat. <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 496), were pirates besides being
    coppersmiths (<span lang="grc">χαλκυές</span>), and who were eventually murdered by their
    wives, represented the ancient Lemnians. So Homer (‘Od.’ viii. 290)
    speaks of the ‘barbarous Sintian men’ who received Vulcan when kicked
    out of Paradise. A modern school of Tsiganologues would identify them
    with prehistoric Gypsies, who have still a tribe called Sindi; but this
    theory would bring the arts from India westwards, whereas the current
    flowed the clean contrary way. Finally, Herodotus (i. 28), initiated in
    the mysteries, makes the Chalybes<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> or iron-workers, neighbours (and
    congeners?) of the Phrygians.</p>

  <p>It is not difficult to see the general gist of such legends. All
    these tribes probably came (like Pelops, Tantalus, and Niobe) from
    the same place, Phrygia, the fertile plateau of Asia Minor, and its
    Katakekaumene or volcanic tract. It was, as far as we know, the first
    western centre which developed the ‘Aryan’ or non-Semitic element of
    the old Egyptian tongue. It also formed the <i lang="fr">point de départ</i> of the
    European<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> (miscalled ‘Indo-European’) branch of the family that
    owned the Arya-land (Airyanem-vaejo), whose ethnic centre was the
    barbarous region about Ray, Heri, or Herat.<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> Hence, says Herodotus
    (iii. 2), the Egyptians owned the Phrygians <span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>to surpass them in
    antiquity. The emigrants would pass to the islands Samothrace, Lemnos,
    Thera,<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> the Cyclades and Crete; to Greece, Thessaly and Epirus,
    Attica, Argos, and the farthest south, where ‘Pelops the Phrygian,’
    son of King Tantalus, colonised the Morea and founded the Pelopid
    race. Then they would find a home in Italy, Hetruria, and Iapygia
    (or Messapia), Peucetia and Daunia, and finally they would settle in
    Iberia, Spain, and Portugal, where the Briges or Brygi (Phrygians) have
    left their names in the Braganza of the present day.</p>

  <p>These Proto-Phrygians and Phrygo-Europeans, of whom several tribes
    returned to Asia, were the prehistoric metal-workers. The smith (from
    <i>smitan</i>, to strike) was sacred in the dawn of history; and the
    Sword-maker was not inferior to him. Those who have witnessed the awe
    and reverence with which savages and barbarians regard a European
    mechanic at his forge will see exemplified the emotional feeling which
    led to the human becoming the superhuman.<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>ALLOYS.</i></div>

  <p>The first step in <span lang="grc">κρατέρωμα</span> (hardening of metals) was, according
    to Hesychius, <span lang="grc">Μίξις χαλκοῦ καὶ κασσιτέρου</span> (the mingling of copper
    and tin). The alloy was known generically as chalcos (base metal),
    specifically as <span lang="grc">χαλκὸς μέλαινος</span> (black chalcos). The Latins persisted
    in terming it simply <i lang="la">æs</i>; e.g. <i lang="la">æs inauratum</i> (gilt bronze). Our
    word bronze derives from <i lang="la">brunus</i> (fuscous, sombre, brown); <i lang="la">brunum
    æs</i>. Hence the Low Latin (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 805) <i lang="la">brunea</i>, <i lang="la">brunia</i>, or
    <i lang="la">bronia</i>, a lorica or thorax; and the Low Greek <span lang="el">πόρτας μπρούτξινες</span>
    (pronounce broutzines), ‘portals of bronze.’ The word is also derived
    from the Basque or Iberian <i>bronsea</i>.</p>

  <p>Tin, one of the least durable of metals, at the same time readily
    fused and one of the easiest to treat metallurgically, was called by
    the Greeks <span lang="grc">κασσίτερος</span>, and by the Latins <i lang="la">cassiteron</i>,<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> whence
    probably the Arab. <span lang="ar">قصدير</span>, and the Sanskrit <span lang="sa">कस्तीर</span>. The Hebrew name is
    <span lang="he">בדיל</span> (Badíl = a substitute, a separation, an alloy). Hut (white metal)
    in Egyptian includes silver and tin: in Coptic it is Thram, Thran, or
    Basensh. Kalaí (Linschoten’s ‘Calaem’) is the popular term for tin in
    India: the word is Arabic rather than Turkish. Tenekeh (tin-plate) in
    Arabic is an evident congener of the Assyrian
    <img class="iglyph-2" src="images/i_077_s.png" alt="" width="65" height="15" /> ‘Anaker,’
    and it remarkably resembles the Scandinavian Din, German Zinn, and our
    Tin. As we find ‘Teyne’ in Chaucer <span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>and old writers, ‘tin’ may come
    from its easy ‘thinning’ or beating out. The later Latins changed the
    <i lang="la">plumbum album</i> or white lead of Pliny (iv. 30) to <i lang="la">stannum</i>: whence
    our word derived through the neo-Latin. The origin of Kassiteron,
    Kasdír, Kastira, is disputed, and philologists remark that Cassi is
    a British (Keltic) prefix, as in Cassi-belanus. Tin was found in the
    Caucasus, in India, in Southern Persia (Drangæ Country); in Tuscany, in
    Iberia (Spain and Portugal),<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> in Sweden, Saxony, Bohemia, Hungary,
    and notably in England. There are still deposits near the modern
    Temeswar (Pannonia), and the granite hills of Gallicia and Zamora are
    not exhausted. It is now produced in Russia, Greenland, the Brazil, and
    the United States. Wilkinson would fetch the alloy of ancient Egypt
    from Spain, India, Malacca, or even from Banca,<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> between Sumatra
    and Borneo; the Banca tin-mines, long worked by the Chinese were first
    visited by the Portuguese in 1506. But compounds of tin and copper
    were common in Egypt at the time of the Sixth Dynasty (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
    3000). Tin is mentioned as early as <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 1452 in the Book of
    Numbers (xxxii. 22), with gold and silver, ‘brass’ (copper, especially
    pyrites), iron, and lead<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> (‘oferet’). In <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 760 the
    prophetic books, called from Isaiah (i. 25) and from Ezekiel (xxii. 18,
    20), make tin an alloy of silver.</p>

  <p>The Egyptians would derive their metals in the first place from Upper
    Egypt; and their first Kheft or mines of gold (<i>khetem</i>) and copper
    lay in the Thebaid. Secondly, they would resort to the land of Midian
    on the eastern flank, and running south of the long narrow gulf,
    El-Akabah: this grand range of Ghats or Coast Mountains was in those
    days a noted mining centre, and it has still a great industrial future.
    Thirdly, by means of the Phœnicians, who apparently taught the Greeks
    metallurgy which they learned in Egypt, they would import their tin
    from Southern France, Spain, and England.<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>TIN.</i></div>

  <p>It is a disputed question whether the Phœnicians discovered the
    tin-stones and the stream-tin of the Cassiterides,<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> or whether the
    ore was worked by the ‘Welsh of the Horn’—the barbarians of Cornwall
    and Devonshire, who in those days were <span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>probably confined to small
    coast-clearings.<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> Herodotus, indeed, knows nothing (iii. 115) of
    ‘any islands called the Cassiterides (tin islands) whence the tin
    comes.’ These Silures or Scilly Islands were evidently mere depôts, not
    sites of production. The Phœnicians kept their secret well, and lost
    their ships rather than betray it; so says Strabo (iii. 5, § 11), whose
    Cassiterides appear to be the Azores.<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> The age when the trade was
    first opened is disputed; some place it <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 1500, others<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a>
    reduce it to <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 400. Diodorus Siculus (v. 21–2) tells us
    that tin was found and run into pigs near the Belerium Promontory
    (Land’s End); thence it was carted to Ictis (Vectis, not the Isle of
    Wight, but Saint Michael’s Mount and Love Island);<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> and lastly
    horsed across Gaul to the Rhone. There is in the Truro Museum<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> a
    pig of tin, flat above and reniform below (the shape of the mould),
    two feet eleven inches by eleven inches broad, with a particular mark;
    it has been suggested that this is Phœnician. ‘Cassiter Street’ in
    Bodmin is supposed to retain the classical name. The second Thursday
    before Christmas Day is called in Cornwall (Kern-Walli, Cornu Galliæ)
    ‘Picrous Day,’ from the man who discovered the ‘streaming’ (or washing)
    of ‘stean’ or tin. Strabo gives a bad account of the people of the
    twelve Cassiterides and their Cornishmen, the latter ‘resembling the
    Furies we see in tragic representations.’ These pleasant persons
    would find stream-tin, almost fit for use, lying upon the surface by
    the side of copper pyrites—the latter harder than tin, but still
    comparatively soft and ductile. Both ores were easily fused, while iron
    was comparatively difficult and tedious to smelt; and the two (copper
    and tin) combined were not only more fusible, but they also continued
    longer in the fluid state, facilitating casting and moulding. Hence
    Worsäae believes that England was an ancient centre of bronze, whence
    the alloy was diffused throughout Europe. It is usually stated that the
    bronze-using period in England began between <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 1400 and
    1200, and lasted eight to ten centuries, the invasion of Cæsar taking
    place during the early ‘Iron Age.’</p>

  <p>The great bronze manufacture which we have first to consider is Egypt.
    The exact average proportion of the alloy is hard to ascertain,<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>
    the tin varying from ten to twenty per cent., and the copper from
    eighty to ninety per cent. A dagger analysed by Vauquelin gave copper
    eighty-five, tin fourteen, and iron one per cent. Wilkinson’s bronze
    chisel, nine and a quarter inches long, and weighing one pound twelve
    ounces, found in a quarry at Thebes, contained in one hundred parts
    94·0 copper, 5·9 tin, 0·1 iron; consequently its edge is at once turned
    by hard stone. He repeatedly mentions bronze chisels (ii. ch. vii.
    &amp;c.), and he seems to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>suspect that they were sheathed and pointed with
    steel. Of course, he was puzzled to explain how the ‘bronze or brass
    blades were given a certain degree of elasticity.’<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></p>

  <div class="figleft col40">

    <div class="caption-j smcap">Fig. 82.—Fine Specimen of Egyptian Dagger in
      possession of Mr. Hayns, brought by Mr. Harris from Thebes.</div>
    <div class="caption-j">The material is bronze, and still is slightly elastic. There is a
      mid-rib, but not strongly marked. The tang, which is continued to the
      pommel, measures 4 inches long by a minimum of <sup>5</sup>/<sub>12</sub>. The handle, of
      two slices of hippopotamus hide, has 26 ridges for firmer grasp, and
      there are rivets of bronze at the 6th and the 23rd ridges. There is no
      pommel, but here the handle is rounded off between two slices of hide,
      and the tang goes right through.</div>
  </div>

  <p>The result of Egyptian metallurgy is admirable, both in material
    and finish. At what period bronze was introduced we ignore; a cast
    cylinder, however, bearing the name of Pepi, dates from <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
    3000 in the Sixth Dynasty of Middle Egypt, which includes Nitaker
    (Nitocris). Knives appear in the sculptures dating from before that
    time. A bronze dagger in the Berlin Museum, found by Sig. Passalacqua
    in a tomb at Thebes, retains a spring which might be of steel. My
    friend, Mr. W. P. Hayns, of the Alexandrian Harbour Works, showed me
    a specimen brought from Thebes by the late Mr. Harris, made of bronze
    still slightly elastic. The total length measures one foot, of which
    the blade is half; the latter, slightly leaf-shaped, has a minimum
    breadth of one inch and three-twelfths, and one inch at the shoulder.
    The tang, which is prolonged to the handle-end (four inches), has a
    minimum width of five-twelfths. The grip of two plates, hippopotamus
    hide (?), probably boiled, and not unlike wood, has twenty-six ridges
    for firmer hold, and there are bronze rivets at the sixth and the
    twenty-third ridges: it is without pommel, the end being simply rounded
    off.</p>

  <p>It is held that mummies of the Eleventh Dynasty were buried with bronze
    sabres; and there is a bronze dagger of Thut-mes<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> III. (Eighteenth
    Dynasty), circa <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 1600. As late as Mene-ptah II. of the
    Nineteenth Dynasty (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 1300–1266), we read in the list of
    his loot, after the Prosopis battle, of bronze-armour, Swords, and
    daggers. Among the Etruscans, before the foundation of Rome, bronze
    statues were known; and Romulus is said to have placed a statue of
    himself, crowned by Victory, in a bronze quadriga taken at Comertium.
    According to Pausanias (iii. 12, § 8), Theodorus of Samos invented
    casting in bronze (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 800–700): this author discredits the
    Arcadian legend that Neptune dedicated a bronze statue to Poseidon (the
    Sidonian?) Hippios (Wilkinson, ii. chap. vii.). But the Samians cast a
    bronze vase in <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 630.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span></p>

  <p>The importance of the Uchatius re-discovery, that is, of hardening
    bronze as well as copper by hydraulic pressure, not by phosphorus,<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a>
    becomes evident by Wilkinson’s reflections. ‘We know of no means of
    tempering copper, under any form, or united with any alloys for such
    a purpose’ (as hollowing out hieroglyphics). He suggests that the old
    Egyptian letters, sometimes exceeding two inches in depth, and the
    alt-reliefs nine inches high, on granite coffins, may have been worked
    with wheel-drill and emery powder.<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> The Egyptians had also the
    secret of gilding bronze, as many of their remains prove; moreover,
    they produced by acids a rich patina of dark and light greens.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>METALLURGY IN ASSYRIA.</i></div>

  <p>The Assyrians rivalled in metallurgy their ancient instructors the
    Egyptians: and the art passed eastwards to Persia, which inherited
    Assyrian and Babylonian civilisation. Diodorus Siculus, following
    Ctesias the oft-quoted contemporary of Xenophon, describes immense
    works of bronze decorating the gardens of Semiramis. In Assyria, again,
    the proportion of the alloy greatly varied. Layard<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> quotes the
    following assays of Assyrian bronze:</p>

    11·33 tin to 99·70 copper. The Mesopotamians were able to cast their
    bronze extremely thin, which is no small difficulty; they fashioned
    it into weapons, temple utensils, and domestic articles, and they
    skilfully ‘elaborated it by chasing and by curious ornamental tracery.’
    They used it in their most sumptuous decorations, as the thrones prove;

  <p>Dr. Schliemann questions the popular assertion that the age of Hesiod
    and of Homer ignored alloys and fusion, knowing only plating, the
    plates being hammer-wrought <span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>(‘Od.’ iii. 425). This explorer found
    the strata of copper and lead scoriæ at the so-called Troy from
    twenty-eight to twenty-nine and a half feet deep. He notes also small
    crucibles and a mould of mica-schist (twenty-six feet deep), which was
    probably intended for bronze casting. He finds no iron; but copper
    and its alloy, bronze, are abundant. M. Damour of Lyon<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> analysed
    the drillings of two ‘copper’ battle-axes from ‘Ilium,’ in fact, from
    ‘Priam’s Treasury’; they contained 0·0864 and 0·0384 parts tin to
    0·9067 and 0·9580 copper. Nearly the same proportion of alloy was found
    in a common two-edged axe dug at a depth of three and a quarter feet,
    and therefore in the remains attributed to a Greek colony. Dr. Percy

    notes the admirable bronze work of the Ynkarial empire.</p>

  <p>A Peruvian chisel, analysed by M. Vauquelin, contained 0·94 copper to
    0·06 tin. In other tools the proportion of the latter metal varied
    from two to four, six and even seven per cent. As a rule the people
    used only half the proper proportion of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>tin, which they called
    Chayantanka—a name suggesting the Old-World ‘Tanuk.’ Humboldt mentions
    a cutting tool found near Cuzco with ninety-four per cent. of copper
    and six of tin. Rivero (i. 201) notices in Peru brass (?) hammers and
    bellows-nozzles, axes, adzes, bill-hooks, and other tools, of bronze
    as well as copper. The Mexicans cast their tin ingots in T-shape. The
    Peruvians hardened copper also with silver for quarrying-tools and
    crow-bars. Velasco (ii. 70) tells us that when the Ynka Huasca was
    being led to prison by order of his brother, a woman secretly gave him
    a bar of metal, ‘silver with bronze, brass, or an alloy of silver,
    copper, and tin’ (Bollaert, p. 90); by means of this he cut through the
    jail wall during the night. Hutchison (ii. 330) mentions a buckler from
    Ipijapa in Ecuador, and Ewbank (p. 454) notices an old Peruvian bronze
    knife.<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>

  <p>The admirable bronzes of China and Japan are well known in the English
    market, and Raphael Pumpelly,<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> who studied direct from the native
    workmen, has printed interesting notes on the ornamental alloys, or
    Mokume, applied to Swords and other articles. Damask-work is produced
    by soldering alternately thirty to forty sheets of rose-copper, silver,
    <i>shakdo</i> (copper one to gold ten per cent.), and <i>gui shi bu ichi</i>
    (silver and copper). The mass is then cut into deep patterns with
    the reamer. An alloy of silver (thirty to fifty per cent. of copper)
    produces the favourite tint, a rich grey colour, and this becomes a
    bluish black like niello by being boiled after polishing in a solution
    of sulphate of copper, alum, and verdigris. Dr. Percy (p. 340)
    describes the liquation of argentiferous copper in Japan.<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></p>

  <p>We owe to Dr. George Pearson<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> sundry experiments in alloys, which
    first determined that the norm of the Old World and the best proportion
    for weapons and tools are one tin to nine copper.</p>

  <p>Fusing the metals, he found:</p>

  <p>1 tin : 20 copper (5 per cent.) produces a dark-coloured bronze with
    the red fracture of the pure metal.</p>

  <p>1 tin : 15 (6½ per cent.) gives a stronger alloy and obliterates the
    colour.</p>

  <p>1 tin : 12, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3 gradually increases hardness and
    brittleness.</p>

  <p>1 tin : 2 makes a mixture almost as brittle as glass.</p>

  <p>The following table<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> shows the alloys now in common use, and the
    purposes to which they are applied:</p>

  <p>The most popular alloy of copper, next to bronze, is brass, which is
    harder and wears better than the pure metal. Originally, as now, it was
    a mixture of copper and zinc, popularly called spelter (old <i>speautre</i>,
    <i>speauter</i>, <i>spiauter</i>, <i>spialter</i>).<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> The proportions greatly
    varied, one part of the latter to two of the former being the older
    ratio, and the density increasing with the amount of copper from 8·39
    to 8·56.</p>

  <p>Beckmann tells us, in his valuable ‘History of Inventions,’<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> ‘in
    the course of time an ore which must have been calamine (carbonate of
    zinc) or blende<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> (sulphuret of zinc), was added to copper, and
    gave it a yellow colour. The addition made it harder, more fusible and
    sonorous, easily subject to the lathe, more economical to work, and a
    worse conductor of heat than the pure metal.’ We have few specimens
    of old art-works in ‘brass’ proper, although zinc was discovered by
    analysis in an ancient Sword, chiefly copper.<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> Gibel assures
    us that zinc occurs only in Roman alloys, the bronze of the Greeks
    containing nothing beyond copper, tin, and lead. The Romans also could
    varnish or lacquer brass, but it is not known whence they derived
    the art. Percy notes (p. 521) that brass was produced ‘early in the
    Christian era, if not before its commencement.’ He quotes in proof a
    large coin of the Cassia Gens (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 20) which contained copper
    82·26 and zinc 17·31; a Vespasian (Rome, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 71), an imperial
    Trajan (Caria, circ. <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 110), a Geta (Carian Mylasa,
    <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 189–212), a Greek Caracalla (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 199), and many
    others. In modern times zinciferous ore was imported by the Portuguese
    from the East a century before it was common throughout Europe.<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a>
    In the early seventeenth century the Dutch captured one of their craft
    laden with spelter, and the secret became known. Bishop Richard Watson
    says (1783) the cargo was <i>calaem</i>, which he connects with ‘calamine’:
    the latter, like the German <i>Galmei</i>, derives from <i>cadmia</i>.</p>

  <p>Amongst the moderns <i lang="la">æs</i> gave rise to <i lang="la">airain</i>. The French <i lang="fr">leton</i>,

  <div class="sidenote"><i>ORICHALCUM.</i></div>

  <p>It may be advisable to notice the <span lang="grc">ὀρειχάλκον</span><a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> of the Homerids
    and Hesiod, which Strabo also calls <span lang="grc">ψευδάργυρος</span> (false silver), and
    <i lang="la">aurichalcum</i>, and which the perverse ingenuity of commentaries has
    made so mysterious.<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> In the poetic phase, which loves the vague,
    this ‘mountain-copper’ was a mythic natural metal, ranking between
    gold and silver, and chimerical as was the <i lang="la">chalcolibanon</i><a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> of the
    Apocalypse (i. 15, ii. 18). The name does not occur in Pindar or the
    Dramatists. Plato (the ‘Critias,’ § ix., treating of Atlantis,<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a>
    America) makes <i lang="la">oreichalc</i>, ‘now known only by name,’ the most
    precious metal after gold. Pliny (xxxiv. 2) tells us truly enough that
    <i lang="la">aurichalcum</i> no longer exists.</p>

  <p>The next application of the word was to ruby copper (?), a suboxide
    whose beautiful crystals are formed in the natural state. Pollux and
    Hesychius the grammarian (<span class="smcap">d.d.</span> 380) define it as copper
    (<span lang="grc">χαλκός</span>) resembling gold; and Cicero puts the question whether, if a
    person should offer a piece of gold for sale, thinking he was disposing
    of only a piece of orichalcum, an honest man ought to inform him <span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>that
    it was really gold, or might fairly buy for a penny what is <em>worth
    a thousand times as much</em>.<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> Buffon compares it with tombac, or
    Chinese copper containing gold.<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> Beckmann (<i>s. v.</i> ‘Tin’) notes
    <i lang="la">aurichalcum</i> or Corinthian brass in Plautus, ‘Auro contra carum.’
    Festus speaks of ‘orichalcum (copper), stannum (zinc or pewter?),
    cassiterum (tin), and aurichalcum (brass).’ The same signification
    occurs in Ambrose, Bishop of Milan (fourth century); in Primasius,
    Bishop of African Adrumetum (sixth century), and in Isidore, Bishop of
    Seville (seventh century). Albertus Magnus (thirteenth century), the
    Dominican monk, in treating ‘De Natura et Commixtione Æris,’ describes
    how <i lang="la">cuprum</i> became <i lang="la">aurichalcum</i>.</p>

  <p>Strabo is mysterious. In one place he tells us that the Cyprian copper
    alone produces the Cadmian stone, copperas-water, and oxide of copper.
    In another (lib. xiii.) he says, ‘There is a stone near Andeira which,
    being burnt, becomes iron. It is then put into a furnace, together
    with some kind of earth,<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> when it (the stone? the earth? or both?)
    drops or distils a <span lang="grc">ψευδάργυρος</span> (mock silver, zinc?), which, with the
    addition of copper, produces what is called <em>the mixture</em>, and which
    some term <i lang="la">oreichalcum</i>.’ Pseudargyros, also found in the neighbourhood
    of Tmolus, would here seem to mean zinc or <i>Cadmia fossilis</i> (natural
    calamine or carbonate of zinc). Pliny (xxxiv. 22) confuses with cadmia,
    furnace calamine, and a particular ore of copper opposed to calchitis.
    When Dioscorides (v. cap. 84) seems to allude to artificial or
    furnace-calamine, an impure oxide of zinc, he may mean the more modern
    <i lang="la">tutiya</i> (Avicenna), <i lang="la">toutia</i>, <i lang="la">thouthia</i>,<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> <i lang="fr">cadmie des fourneaux</i>,
    or tutty. Reduced to powder, and mixed with an equal quantity of wetted
    charcoal by way of fondant or flux, it is melted with copper to form
    brass. The Avocat de Launey (1780) and Bishop Watson both agree that
    Strabo’s orichalcum is brass.</p>

  <p>Lastly, aurichalcum was made synonymous with <i lang="la">electrum</i>, natural
    or artificial. The word <span lang="grc">Ἤλεκτρος</span><a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> is popularly derived from
    Helios, as rivalling the sun in <span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>sheen. According to Lepsius it is
    the ‘usem’-metal of Thut-mes III.; Brugsch (i. 345) understands by
    ‘usem’ brass, and thinks Asmara or Asmala equivalent to the Hebrew
    <i lang="he-Latn">hasmal</i> or <i lang="he-Latn">hashmal</i> = <i lang="la">electrum</i>. In Bunsen (v. 757) Kasabet and
    Kakhi are brass (<i lang="la">aurichalcum</i>), and Khesbet is a metal connected with
    Kassiteros = tin. The alloy was known to Hesiod (‘Scut.’ 142) and to
    the ‘Odyssey’<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> (iv. 73), not to the ‘Iliad.’ Sophocles (‘Antig.’
    1037) applied ‘Sardian electrum’ to gold, not to silver. Herodotus
    (iii. 115), in the historic age (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 480–30), gives the
    name of the mythical metal to the ‘tears of the Heliades,’ which the
    Latins called <i lang="la">succinum</i> (<i lang="la">succum</i>), the Low-Latins <i lang="la">ambrum</i>, the Arabs
    <i lang="ar-Latn">anbar</i>, and we Amber. Pliny (xxxiii. 23), repeated by Pausanias (v.
    12, § 6), notes two kinds, natural (‘in all gold ore there is some
    silver’<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a>) and artificial; in the latter the proportion of silver
    must not exceed one-fifth. The staters of Lydian Crœsus, held by the
    Greeks to be the most ancient of coins, were, according to Böckh, of
    electrum, three parts gold and one part silver. Lucian applies the term
    to glass (<span lang="grc">ὕαλος</span>); and, lastly, it was taken for brass and confounded
    with aurichalcum.<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></p>

  <p>I would suggest that this aurichalcum might also be the ‘Dowris
    bronze’ of Ireland, so called because first observed at Dowris, near
    Parsonstown, King’s County. Wilde (p. 360) supposes with others that
    the gold-coloured alloy depended upon the admixture of a certain
    proportion of lead, and compares it with the Cyprus copper termed by
    the Romans <i lang="la">Coronarium</i> (used for theatrical crowns), which was coated
    with ox-gall.<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> Of this <i>or molu</i> there are many articles in the
    Dublin Museum, preserving their fine golden-yellow lustre: they had
    probably been lacquered or varnished like modern brasses; and the
    patina might be some gum-resin. When much tarnished, they were cleaned
    by holding over the fire, and then by dipping in a weak solution of
    acid, as is done with modern castings. Two specimens, a Sword and a
    dagger-blade, were analysed (pp. 470, 483), and proved to contain
    copper 87·67 to 90·72, tin 8·52 to 8·25, lead 3·87 to 0·87, with a
    trace of sulphur in the Sword.<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> The specific gravities were 8·819
    to 8·675. In a spear-head (p. 512), besides copper, tin, and lead, iron
    0·31 and cobalt 0·09 were found.</p>

  <p>There were other alloys of which we read but know little; such were the
    <i lang="la">æs ægineticum</i>, <i lang="la">demonnesium</i>, and <i lang="la">nigrum</i>; the <i lang="la">æs deliacum</i>, whose
    secret was <span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>lost in Plutarch’s day, and the <span lang="grc">Ταρτήσσιος χαλκὸς</span><a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a>
    from Southern Spain, probably shipped at Gibraltar Bay. <i>Ollaria</i> or
    pot-copper (brass) contained three pounds of <i>plumbum argentarium</i>
    (equal parts of tin and lead) to one hundred pounds of copper. <i lang="la">Æs
    caldarium</i> could only be fused. Finally, <i lang="la">græcanicum</i> (Greek-colour)
    was mould or second-hand copper (<i lang="la">formalis seu collectaneus</i>) with ten
    per cent. of <i lang="la">plumbum nigrum</i> (lead) and five per cent. of silver lead
    (argentiferous galena?).</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>THE CELT AND THE SWORD.</i></div>

  <p>Metal, when first introduced, must have been rare and dear; the large
    modern Sword, axe, or mall would hardly have been imitated in copper,
    bronze, or iron. The earliest attempts at developing the celt<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a>
    would have produced nothing more artful than a cutting and piercing
    wedge of the precious substance (fig. 85). As smelting and moulding
    improved, the pointed end would develop into the knife, the dagger,
    and the Sword; and the broad end would expand to the axe. This
    composite weapon, uniting the club with the celt or hand-hatchet, and
    appearing in Europe with the beginning of the Neolithic period, plays a
    remarkable part in history, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>ancient, mediæval, and even modern; whilst
    its connection with the Sword is made evident by the ‘glaive.’<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> The
    expansion of the edge and of the flanges developed two principal forms.
    For cutting wood the long-narrow was found most serviceable: where
    brute force was less required, the weapon became a broad blade with a
    long crescent-shaped edge.</p>

  <p>The Akhu or war-axe was, as we might expect, known to ancient Egypt
    in early days, and became an <i lang="fr">objet de luxe</i>. A gold hatchet and
    several of bronze were found buried as amulets in the coffin of Queen
    Askhept, the ancestress of the Eighteenth Dynasty. Again, a bronze
    weapon occurred with a mummied queen of the Seventeenth Dynasty
    (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 1750). Useful in war, the implement, probably when in
    the stone period, rose to be a symbol of the Deity: hence, doubtless,
    the <i lang="fr">hâches votives</i> of the later Bronze Age without edge to serve for
    work or weapons, and intended only for religious use. The two-headed
    weapon was that outward and visible sign of Labrandian Jove, so
    called from the <span lang="grc">λάβρα</span>, which in the Lydian tongue was synonymous with
    <span lang="grc">πέλεκυς</span>. The emblem appears on the medals of three Carian kings, the

    the axe from their crabs, ... because it appears that the crabs alone
    have the figure of the axe in their shells.’ Hence the double-headed
    weapon on the coins of Tenedos is <span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>a votive or sacrificial, rather than
    a warlike, symbol. The Tenedian Apollo also held the axe, which some
    regarded as the symbol of Tennes. Aristotle and others maintained that
    a certain King of Tenedos decreed that adulterers should be slain with
    the axe, and his carrying out the law upon his own son gave rise to
    the proverb, <span lang="grc">Τενέδιος πέλεκυς</span>, denoting a rough-and-ready way of doing
    business.</p>

  <p>Although the <span lang="grc">πέλεκυς</span> is mentioned by Homer (‘Il.’ and ‘Od.’) as a
    weapon as well as a tool, the Greeks, like the Assyrians, did not
    much affect it. The Romans, who worshipped Quirinus in spear-shape,
    bound the securis in a bundle of rods (<i lang="la">fasces</i>), bore it as a badge
    of office, and placed it on consular coins. The weapon was lowered
    in the salute, and thus, perhaps, arose our practice of dropping the
    Sword-point, which is unknown to the East. The axe with expanded
    blade upon Trajan’s column is in the hands of a workman. Possibly the
    classics of Europe despised the weapon because it was proper to the
    <i lang="la">securigeræ catervæ</i> of the effeminate East. As early as the days of
    Herodotus (I. chap. i. 215) the <span lang="grc">σάγαρις</span>, the Armenian <i>sacr</i>, and the
    Latin <i lang="la">securis</i>, made either of gold or chalcos, was the favourite
    weapon of the Amazon<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> and the Massagetæ<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> horseman. In Ireland
    the axe plays a part in the tales of Gobawn Saer: this goblin-builder
    completed the dangerous task of finishing off a royal roof of cutting
    wooden pegs, throwing them one by one into their places, and driving
    them in by flinging the magic weapon at each peg in due succession.</p>

  <p>From Egypt the axe passed into the heart of Africa. Here it still
    serves, before and after use, as a medium of exchange; and this
    circulation from tribe to tribe explains the various forms that have
    overspread the Dark Continent. The Nile Valley again sent it eastward
    through Hittite-land and Assyria to Persia and India, where the
    crescent-shaped battle-axe has long been a favourite. The varieties of
    form and colour are noticed by Duarte Barbosa<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> when describing the
    ‘Moors’ of Hormuz Island. It was adopted by the Turkish horseman, who
    carried it at his saddle-bow. Klemm (‘Werkzeuge und Waffen’) notices
    that it was a favourite Scandinavian weapon slung by a strap to the
    back; and most of the deaths recounted in ‘Burnt Njal’ are the result
    of it. The Norman long-hefted axe is common on the Bayeux tapestries.
    A Scandinavian war-axe of the early seventeenth century was found on
    the battle-field of Norwegian Kringelen; the handle is recurved so
    as to fit the back socket. In Germany it was generally used during
    the fifteenth century; in England during the sixteenth; and in the
    seventeenth it became obsolete throughout Europe, except among the
    Slavs and the Magyars. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>The German processional axe shows its latest
    survival; blade and handle are of one piece of wood, ornamented with
    the guild-devices, and so modified that the original weapon can hardly
    be recognised. Similarly the Bergbarthe (mine-picks) of the German
    Bergmänner (miners) were used, according to Klemm, for the defence
    of cities, notably of Freiberg in 1643; and, made of brass as well
    as iron, they are still carried in State processions. The axe, like
    the spear, demarked boundaries. The charter given by Cnut (Canute)
    to Christ Church, Canterbury, grants the harbour and dues thereof on
    either side as far as a man standing on deck at flood-tide could cast a
    taper-axe, and the custom of throwing the tool to mark boundaries has
    been retained in some parts of the country to our day. It was with a
    battle-axe that the Bruce of Bannockburn clove the skull of an English
    champion to the chin. Monstrelet tells us that during the wars of
    Jeanne d’Arc (Patay fought in <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1429) the English carried
    hatchets in their girdles.</p>

  <p>The Axe<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> was adopted by the Franks, as well as by the Scandinavians
    and the Germans, especially the Saxons. Hence the two-edged axe
    when affixed to long staves, forming a spear, became the Icelandic
    Hall-bard<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> (hall-axe?), the Teutonic <span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>Alle-barde (‘all-cleaver’),
    and the ‘Pole-axe,’ called from Poland (= Polje, the plain-country).
    This modification was universal in Northern Europe during the first
    ages of Christianity. The earliest shape (middle fourteenth to early
    sixteenth centuries) was a broad and massive axe, mounted on a thick
    and solid spear; in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the
    blade became more slender and hollow-edged, and the head longer and
    more taper. The Swiss introduced the Halbert to France in the middle
    fifteenth century: in the seventeenth century it was conventionalised,
    the axe resumed its original aspect, and the spear grew to leaf-shape.
    In this form it was retained by the subalterns and sergeants of the
    British army till abolished with the pig-tails of ‘Shaven England.’ It
    is not wholly forgotten on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span> ceremonious occasions in certain European
    Courts, and during all its changes it has ever retained its cousinly
    likeness to the broadsword.</p>

  <p>I have shown how the stone celt might become a metal knife, and thence
    develop into the straight Sword. By noting the modifications it is as
    easy to see that the axe might have produced the scymitar. The earliest
    form would be a broad lance-head inserted into a common club (<i>a</i>), as
    is still practised in many parts of Africa. The next improvement (<i>c</i>)
    would convert the tool into an arm by increasing the cutting surface;
    and another step (<i>d</i>) would make it lighter by reducing the blade to
    a triangle of mere barbs, <b>⊣</b>. Then (<i>e</i>) we have the Khond or
    Circar battle-axe, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span> the Silepe of the South African Basutos who,
    virtually discovered by Dr. Livingstone, have become so troublesome of
    late years.<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> This T-shaped blade, perpetuated in the ‘Baïonette
    Gras,’ was used in Switzerland and in Venice till the sixteenth
    century, according to Meyrick and Demmin. Afterwards the straight back
    next to the staff would be formed into two small and graceful crescents
    (<i>f</i>); and the weapon became far better fitted for the requirements
    of cavalry. This shape is world-wide, and was used in England <i>temp.</i>
    Elizabeth. A congener of the glaive was the <i lang="fr">Francisque à lance
    ouverte</i>, the broad-bladed ‘taper-axe,’ used for throwing as well as
    for striking. According to the Abbé Cochet, this weapon took its name
    from the Franks. The Francisque is termed a ‘defensive weapon’ in the
    illustrated treatise ‘Armes et Armures.’<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> The Saxons preferred to
    it the Sahs, Seax or Scramasax-knife, similarly used. The Francisque is
    rare in the Saxon graves compared with the spear and knife, but it is
    more common than the Sword.<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a></p>

  <p>The glaive of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries was followed by
    the Guisarme, Gisarme, or Bisarme. This long blade, with a slender
    spear-point projecting from the back, is still used by the Chinese; and
    the Despots of Dahome borrowed it, like other quaint arms and customs,
    from Europe. The <i>Voulge</i>, an intermediate form of the halbert and the
    glaive, and probably a descendant of the former, was a battle-axe much
    used by the Swiss in the fourteenth century. The war-scythe of the same
    period figured by Demmin, and the scythe-Sword—a formidable-looking,
    but unhandy weapon—were adopted by the Hungarian rebels as lately
    as in 1848. Allied with these mediæval forms is a vast variety of
    shapes known as the Spetum (Spiedo or Spit), the Ronçeur or Ranseur,
    and the military fork. They were probably known to the Ancients, and
    reintroduced into Europe by the peasantry who, compelled hastily to
    arm themselves, would use the handy flails, sickles, and scythes. A
    well-arranged and complete collection is still wanted to show the links
    connecting them with a common prototype.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span></p>

  <p>The interest of these weapons is chiefly connected with the various
    forms of curved broadsword. The leaf-shaped metal-blade for thrusting,
    which appears to be one of the earliest forms, and which is preserved
    by the Somal and other barbarians, is, I have said, evidently a
    spear-head fixed in a wooden handle.</p>

  <p>Briefly to describe the Sword of the Early Bronze Age, during which,
    by the by, cremation became almost universal in Europe. The weapon
    is to a certain extent North European, and seems to have travelled
    up the valleys of great rivers: Denmark has yielded two hundred and
    fifty to six Italian bronze blades.<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> They are as a rule of fair
    length, averaging about seventy-five centimetres: the profile is either
    leaf-shaped, sub-leaf-shaped, or straight, ending in a bevelled point.
    The hilt is of two kinds: either tanged or untanged: the tang is broad,
    long, and pierced, with one or more holes for riveting; in this case
    the handle was of wood, bone, or horn. Many hefts, however, as will
    afterwards appear, are cast in a single piece with or without guard;
    and the latter often disappears in a hollow triangular base, a crescent
    or horse-shoe containing the shoulders with the concavity of the arch
    towards the point; this also served in many weapons to receive the
    rivets. The pommel is of various patterns, frequently a cone, oval,
    globe, or dome with steps or with melon-like ridges.<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> In others,
    especially amongst the old Kelts and Germans, it ended with a crutch or
    crescent whose cusps were, in the richer kinds, adorned with spirals.</p>

  <p>According to the Parian Chronicle (Arundelian Marbles), followed by
    Thrasyllus (Clemens Alex. in ‘Strom.’), and by a host of writers,
    iron-working was discovered in <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 1432 or 248 years before
    the Trojan war. The latter, a crucial date, is, as will appear, wholly
    undetermined; the various authorities have made it range through nearly
    seven hundred years. But the life of Hellas is one great ‘appropriation
    clause’: the Greeks were doughty claimants, childish in their <i lang="fr">naïveté</i>
    of conceit; they were burglars of others’ wits (convey, the wise it
    call), and they made themselves do all things. Their legends, for
    instance, accredit ‘Glaucus the Chian’ with having invented the art
    and mystery of steel-inlaying. De Goguet (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1761) tells us
    that the Phœnicians ranked amongst their oldest heroes two brothers
    who discovered iron-working; the Cretans referred it to the oldest
    period of their history,<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> and the Idæan Daktyls learnt it from the
    ‘mother of the gods.’ Prometheus (in Æschylus) boasts of having taught
    mankind to fabricate all metals: he also wears an iron ring supposed
    to be a chain not an ornament; and it possibly symbolises the union of
    fire and ore. The art of iron-working is referred, now to the Cyclopes,
    of Sicily, then to the Chalybes,<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> who extended from <span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>Colchis to
    Spain: Clemens (Alex.) refers the discovery of making malleable iron to
    the Noropes of Danubian Pannonia, who dwelt between Noricum (Styria)
    and Mæsia; and finally, to quote no more, Mr. J. Fergusson, a careful
    writer, tells us that ‘the Aryans (?) were those who introduced the use
    of iron, and with it dominated over and expelled (?) the older races.’</p>

  <p>Modern discovery has proved that the invention, and indeed the general
    adoption, of ‘Mars’ (♂) dates from the very dawn of history; and that
    it is a mere theory to assume everywhere preceding millennia of bone
    and stone, copper and bronze. It is clear, for instance, in Central
    Africa, where copper and tin were unprocurable, that man must first
    have used iron.<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> A good authority, Mr. St. John V. Day<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a>
    (C.E.), who was in charge of iron works in Southern India, claims for
    iron—cast as well as wrought, and even for its carburet, steel—the
    credit of being ‘unquestionably the earliest of substances with which
    man was acquainted.’ This writer, however, denies, contrary to all
    tradition, a ‘progressive rise in the quality of materials used by
    man’: that is, from the soft and yielding to the hard and refractory.
    He holds that Man, once master of metallurgy, ‘would be better able
    to deal with the much more easily manipulated bones, stones, or
    wood.’ He supposes all the metals, noble and ignoble, as well as gems
    and precious stones, to have become familiar amongst Eastern races,
    ‘whether they be Semitic, Aryan, Hamitic, Sporadic, or Allophyllian,
    by virtue of a civilisation due to a natural innate insight.’ Hence
    he declares Egypt an enigma to those who accept the dictum of ‘man’s
    gradual evolution from the condition of a savage, an ignoramus,’ and he
    opines that this grim being is simply a retrograde.<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a></p>

  <p>These ideas trench upon old metallurgic superstitions and seem to run
    into extremes. We <em>know</em> nothing concerning the home of Proto-man,
    which is perhaps deep under the waters. Anthropologists, who locate him
    in Mesopotamia, ‘Aryaland’ (Central Asia), or Ethiopia, look only to
    the origin of the present species, and the historic cycle. Our studies,
    as far as they go, suggest that Man began in the Polar regions, and
    that in hoar antiquity each racial centre had its own material—wood
    and horn, bone and stone, copper, bronze, and iron.<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a></p>

  <p>Mr. Day (who has drawn it up) observes that ‘BA’
    <span class="xlarge">(</span><img class="iglyph-4" src="images/i_099_s6.png" alt="" width="17" height="25" /><span class="xlarge">)</span> is a
    constant in the phonetic values assigned to the uncertain hieroglyphs
    for iron, and feels disposed to believe it synonymous with <span lang="grc">χαλκός</span>,
    base metal in general. He would translate the Saidic ‘<span lang="grc">ΒΕΝΙΠΕ</span>’ and the
    Coptic ‘<span lang="grc">ΠΕΝΙΠΕ</span>’ by ‘stone (<span lang="grc">ΒΕ</span>) of (<span lang="grc">ΝΙ</span>) sky or heaven (<span lang="grc">ΠΕ</span>)’; in fact,
    ‘sky-stone,’ alluding to meteoric iron, probably the first utilised.
    Dr. Birch holds ‘BA’ to be a general term for metal made particular, as
    in Greece, by prefixed adjectives (white, black, yellow) denoting the
    quality of the ore. And hence the determinative of ‘BA’ (metal, stone,
    or hard wood) is the cube or parallelogrammic block which denotes
    building and building materials.</p>

  <p>Native iron may be distributed into two great divisions,
    extra-terrestrial and terrestrial. The former is known as meteoric
    or nickeliferous. Mr. Day (pp. 22–23) gives analyses of this form,
    and takes, from Chladni<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> and others, a list of masses that fell
    in Siberia, Thuringia, and Dauphiné; in West African Liberia, and in
    American Sta. Fé de Bogotá, and Canaan, Connecticut. Though many trials
    have been made in working extra-terrestrial metal, all have hitherto
    failed; the phosphorus, nickel and its <i>alter ego</i>, cobalt, render the
    forgings, in our present state of technology, too brittle for use.
    Terrestrial or telluric iron is again divided into two classes—the
    nearly pure ore and the native steel. According to the schedule of
    Rosset:</p>

  <p class="noindent">That iron was common amongst the ancient Egyptians we may assume as
    proved. Mr. A. Henry Rhind, when opening the tomb of Sebau (nat.
    <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 68), noted on the massive doors ‘iron hasps and nails,’
    ‘as lustrous and as pliant as on the day they left the forge.’ Belzoni,
    who died in 1823, found an iron sickle under the feet of one of the
    Karnak Sphinxes dating from <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 600. In June 1837, Mr. J. R.
    Hill, employed by Colonel Howard Vyse, when blasting and excavating
    the Jízeh<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> Pyramid, came upon a piece of iron, apparently a cramp,
    near the channel-mouth of one of the air-passages: it had thus been
    preserved from rust, and its authenticity cannot be doubted. Some
    suggested that it was used for scraping and finishing; others for
    finally levelling the faces of dressed stone, but it tapers off from
    the middle to an edge on either side and it narrows at one end.<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a>
    This relic can hardly be of later date than <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 4000–3600,
    when Khufu (Cheops) built his burial-place and inscribed in it his
    hieroglyphic shield<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> or cartouche
    <img class="iglyph-6" src="images/i_100_s.png" alt="" width="87" height="30" />.
    Stowed away
    in the British Museum, it excited scant attention till Dr. Lepsius at
    the Congress of Orientalists (London, 1874), suggested that it was
    of steel. A trial was made (Sept. 18); it yielded readily to a few
    turns of the drill, and the surfaces of the hole showed the whiteness
    and the brightness of newly-cut malleable iron. Since that discovery,
    sacrificial iron knives have been found in the Nile Valley, despite the
    ready oxidation of the metal in a climate of the hot-damp category.
    In the Bulák Museum (Salle de l’Est), with the wooden Swords, was
    a straight and double-edged iron blade that had two ribs running
    along its length. Another room showed a straight, double-edged, and
    round-pointed dagger of gilt iron. Of the latter weapon there are three
    fine specimens (Salle du Centre).</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>IRON IN EGYPT.</i></div>

  <p>The literature of Egypt abounds in allusions to the use of iron.<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a>
    The Rev. Basil H. Cooper<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> believes that Mibampes the ‘Iron King,’
    sixth successor of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>primæval Mena (circ. <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 4560),<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a>
    bore on his cartouche the word ‘Benipe’; and that no less than three
    records<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> entitle him ‘Lover of Iron’ (i.e. the Sword); ‘thus
    attesting, not only the extreme antiquity of the use of iron, but
    unfortunately (?) of that most dreadful evil of all which are the
    scourges of humanity—war (?).’ And so we see the nineteenth century
    repeating the Herodotian half-truth, ‘Iron has been discovered to the
    hurt of Man’; and looking only at one side of the question, the evils
    of War, without which, I repeat, strong races could not supplant the
    weaker to the general benefit of mankind. The Epos of Pentaur, the
    jovial temple scribe<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> (circ. <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 1350), mentions ‘iron’
    thrice; and Pharaoh Mene-Ptah II., whose ‘Sword gave no quarter,’ had
    vessels of iron. In later hieroglyphic literature the notices become
    too numerous to justify quotation.</p>

  <p>The old Egyptians, according to Plutarch,<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> held iron to be the
    <span lang="grc">ὀστέον Τυφῶνος</span>, or bone of Set; whereas the <span lang="grc">σιδηρίτις λίθος</span>, or magnet,
    was that of his foe-god Horus, degraded to Charon in Greece and Rome.
    This siderite was known to the Hellenes in its religious aspect as
    <span lang="grc">Ἡράκλεια λίθος</span> or <span lang="grc">Ἡράκλειον</span>, either from Heraclea-town or from Hercules
    (Pliny, xxxvi. 25). Siderite or loadstone, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>termed ‘Magnet’ from its
    supposed discoverer, was also entitled ‘live iron,’ and its wounds were
    supposed to be more deadly than those of the common ore.</p>

  <p>The Nile-dwellers had not far to go for iron, which abounds in the
    well-known Wady Hammámát, one of the earliest centres of Egyptian
    mining; and, as Mr. Piazzi Smyth showed, it accumulates everywhere in
    the fissures of the flaky limestone:<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> it is produced in Ethiopia
    (the Sudan and Abyssinia); and in Midian, where the old Kemites opened
    the copper mines, it appears in the shape of black sand and large
    masses of titaniferous<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> and other ores. The monuments (Karnak
    Table, &amp;c.) specify, amongst objects of tribute, iron from the lands
    of the Thuhi<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> (‘the fair people’), the Rutennu (Syrians and
    Assyrians), and the Asi (or rebels generally?); from these countries it
    was exported in the ore and in bricks and pigs. The tribute-tables of
    Thut-mes III. (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 1600) mention:—</p>

  <p>Mr. Francis Galton<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> first discovered in the ancient copper-diggings
    of the so-called ‘Sinaitic’ peninsula, a blackish mass, not unlike
    iron-slag, which he conjectured to date before Moses’ days. A score
    of years afterwards (early 1873), Mr. Hartland<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> examined the
    junction of the Wadys Kemeh, Mukattab, and Maghárah, and found the
    iron-ore imperfectly extracted: assays and analyses of the slags that
    lay in heaps about the ruined works produced fifty-three per cent.
    of metal. He determined that the mines at Serábit El-Khádim had been
    constructed on the principle of the Catalan (or rather the Corsican)
    forge;<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> and he discovered near them a temple and barracks for the
    soldier-guards.<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span></p>

  <p>It is hard to believe with Mr. Proctor that Abraham, a wandering
    Chaldæan Shaykh, taught the Egyptians astronomy, astrology, and
    arithmetic; or with Mr. Piazzi Smyth, that Melchisedek, the petty
    chief of a village in Palestine, built <em>the</em> Pyramid. Yet it is
    only reasonable to suppose that the Israelites set out upon their
    exodus or exodi, for there were probably many, provided with some
    of the technological wisdom of the Egyptians. Joseph, according to
    Brugsch (‘Hist.’ I. chap. xii.), rose to the honour of Zaphnatpaneakh
    (Governor of the Sethroitic home), and Ro-hir or Procurator, under the
    Shepherd-kings or ‘Hyksos,’ a word which he renders Hek-Shasu,<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a>
    lord of the Shasu (Arabs); he makes the Pharaoh of the Oppression,
    Ramses II. (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 1333–1300), and Mene-Ptah II. the Pharaoh
    of the Exodus (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 1300–1266). The Pentateuch, whatever be
    its date, well knew the use of Barzil (<span lang="he">ברזל</span>), the Chaldæan Parzil or
    Parzillu. According to Sir John Lubbock (‘Prehistoric Man’), ‘iron’ is
    four times mentioned, and ‘brass’ (copper, bronze?) thirty-eight times
    in ‘the Law.’<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> From other sources we gather that the metal was
    either <span lang="he">עשות</span> (<i lang="he-Latn">ashúth</i>, that is, ‘the worked,’ from the rad. <i lang="he-Latn">ashah</i>),
    or <span lang="he">מוצק</span> (<i lang="he-Latn">muzak</i>, ‘the melted,’ fused, cast; from the root <i lang="he-Latn">zak</i>). The
    Lord threatens that He will make ‘the skies as iron and the earth as
    copper’ (Levit. xxvi. 19). In Deuteronomy (iv. 20), Egypt is compared
    with an iron furnace; and mention is made of iron shoes (xxxiii. 25).
    Job includes among riches, cattle, silver, gold, brass (copper?), and
    iron; he tells us (xxviii. 2) that ‘iron is taken out of the earth and
    copper is molten out of the stone,’ and he speaks of lithic writing
    (xix. 24), ‘graven with an iron style and lead in the rock for ever.’
    But commentators are not agreed about the age of this author, and in
    the hands of the Rabbis he seems gradually to be growing younger—more
    modern—with every generation.</p>

  <p>The Hebrews found the Iron-age wherever they went. ‘Barzil’ was among
    the metals taken from the Midianites by Moses (Numb. xxxi. 22). The
    ‘bedstead,’ or rather divan, of Og, the King of Bashan, measuring nine
    cubits of man (each = sixteen inches) in length by four broad, was of
    iron (Deut. iii. 11). Joshua shows that the Canaanites owned ‘chariots
    of iron’ (xvii. 16). These tribes, displaced by the Jews, seem to have
    been accomplished workers in metal.<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> Traces of iron-smelting occur
    on the Libanus,<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> where I found copper-stone,<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> and where, during
    the present century, coal and asphalte have been mined. Many parts
    of the country, as Argob in ancient Bashan, produce an abundance of
    ironstone.<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> The old Phœnician Sanconiathon, a name which may denote
    a history or its historian, tells us through the Greek translator Philo
    of Byblus, that the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>people were famous for their Technites, artisans
    and blacksmiths. The warlike Hittites, as will appear, were also
    iron-workers.</p>

  <p>From Egypt the use of iron would spread through Asia Minor<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a>
    eastward to Naharayn,<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> the two-river-land, Mesopotamia. But the
    date is disputed. The excavations of the late Mr. George Smith yielded
    no iron articles older than <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 1000–800. Mr. Day remarks
    that ‘whilst Mesopotamia has not, up to the present time, produced any
    solid evidence in the form of material iron relics belonging to the
    oldest monarchies; nevertheless, the monuments of those earliest times
    are numerous, and they yield abundance of testimony to the acquaintance
    of the contemporary people with iron.’ In later ages he alludes to the
    rings and bangles of iron in the British Museum, which were possibly
    chain-links; and particularly to the ‘ombos of a shield,’ as the most
    exquisite piece of their hammered iron-work he has met with: he doubts
    if it can in some respects be surpassed by the productions of to-day.
    The cuneiforms speak of iron fetters, and the people of the great
    Interamnian plain knew the art of casting bronze over iron,<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> only
    lately introduced into our metallurgy.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>IRON IN ASSYRIA.</i></div>

  <p>According to Mr. G. Smith there is no pure Assyrian word for
    ‘iron.’<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> Its cuneiform symbol is
    <img class="iglyph-2" src="images/i_104_s1.png" alt="" width="42" height="15" />,
    but the phonetic
    value or pronunciation has not yet been determined. ‘It must have
    been in use 2000 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>,’ and it is found in inscriptions of
    all ages. The word is supposed to belong to the ancient Turanian
    or Proto-Babylonian race (Akkadian<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> or Sumirian) that held the
    river-plains, and it has been grafted into the more recent Assyrian
    language. In the inscriptions, each god has his sign, and the symbol
    above given, accompanies, as his attribute, one of the deities of war
    and hunting: thus it is a parallel to that found in the cartouche of
    the Egyptian ‘Iron King.’</p>

  <p>Canon Rawlinson,<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> on the other hand, assigns to the symbol the
    phonetic value of <i>Hurud</i>, which thus became the Chaldæan equivalent
    for ‘iron.’ In concert with his distinguished brother, he came to the
    conclusion: ‘There are two signs for metals in Assyria, with respect
    to which there is a doubt which is iron and which is brass (or bronze
    rather). These are
    <img class="iglyph-2" src="images/i_104_s1.png" alt="" width="42" height="15" /> and
    <img class="iglyph-2" src="images/i_104_s2.png" alt="" width="24" height="15" />.
    Sir Henry
    Rawlinson, on the whole, inclines to regard the first as bronze and the
    second <span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>as iron, although the former is nowhere rendered phonetically.
    The latter is rendered in a syllabary as equivalent to <i>Hurud</i> in
    Akkadian and <i>Eru</i> in Assyrian. Mr. George Smith reverses the meanings
    of the two signs. The point is a very doubtful one.’</p>

  <p>After the decay of the Proto-Babylonian or Chaldæan empire
    (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 2300–1500), when the seat of Interamnian rule moved to
    the Tigris-Euphrates basin, and the three Assyrian periods flourished
    (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 1500–555),<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> iron was largely used. It was produced,
    according to Layard (<i>loc. cit.</i>) in the Tiyari mountains, and it is
    still found in quantities on the slopes, three or four days’ journey
    from Mosul. The north-western palace of Nimrúd (Kalah) showed, amongst
    the rubbish-heaps, much rusty iron and a perfect helmet like that
    represented in the bas-reliefs. There were Swords and daggers, shields
    and shield-handles, rods, and the points of spears and arrows, which
    fell to pieces on exposure. Amongst the few specimens preserved were
    the head of a trident-like weapon, some Sword-handles, a large blunt
    spear-pile, the point of a pick, several objects resembling the heads
    of sledge-hammers, and a double-handed saw of iron or steel (?), about
    three feet eight inches long by four inches and five-eighths broad,
    for cross-cutting timber. The British Museum owns a fine collection
    of Assyrian sheet or plate iron-work; pieces of unfinished forgings;
    a rude triangular lump through which a round hole has been driven
    (by a heated punch?); several cylindrical bars, straight and curved;
    wall-cramps, nails, and door-hinges; a ladle; rings of sizes (one being
    three inches in diameter); a signet-ring containing a silver bezel or
    seal; and, lastly, a portion of what seems to have been a double-sided
    comb. In much later days the Assyrians of Xerxes’ army carried,
    according to Herodotus, shields, spears, daggers, and wooden clubs
    spiked with iron.</p>

  <p>The Greeks learned their metallurgy, as they did all their arts, from
    Egypt; and, following in the footsteps of the Phœnicians, diffused
    them throughout the Western World. In Theseus’ time, according to
    Wilkinson—that is, <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 1235—‘iron is conjectured not to
    have been known, as he was found buried with a brass (copper, bronze?)
    Sword and spear.’ They did not use iron weapons, and probably had no
    iron during their first foreign campaign—the Trojan war. The Parian
    (Arundelian) Chronicle (dating its notices from Cecrops, <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
    1582) and the Rhodian myths refer to a conflagration in the Cretan
    mountains which taught <span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>metallurgy to the Idæan Daktyls (<span lang="grc">Δάκτυλοι
    Ἰδαῖοι</span>):<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> this would, however, be a comparatively late date when we
    regard Egypt.<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a></p>

  <p>With respect to the metal in the Hissarlik remains, Dr. Schliemann
    remarks (i. 31): ‘The only objects of iron which I found were a key
    of curious shape and a few arrows and nails close to the surface.’ It
    is no proof that it was used because Homer some centuries afterwards
    spoke of the <span lang="grc">κύανος</span> (<i lang="grc-Latn">cyanus</i>), steel tempered blue, a word which even
    in antiquity was translated by <span lang="grc">χάλυψ</span> (<i>chalybs</i>, steel). The explorer
    remarks: ‘Articles of steel may have existed: I believe positively
    that they did exist; but they have vanished without leaving a trace
    of their existence; for, as we know, iron and steel become decomposed
    much more readily than copper.’ Yet, so contradictory is the whole
    book, and so uncertain are its conclusions, we find,<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> ‘No. 4.
    Drillings of one of the Trojan sling-bullets, externally covered with
    verdigris, and internally the colour of iron’; while the assay shows
    that it consisted chiefly of copper and sulphur. Among the contemporary
    (?) finds of Mycenæ, which not a few authorities have pronounced
    to be Byzantine, and another observer Keltic,<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> Dr. Schliemann
    met with iron in the shape of knives and keys; but he holds these
    articles to be of comparatively late date, not older than the fifth
    century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span><a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> At that time iron must have been general
    throughout Greece. In the fourth century, Aristotle (‘Meteorologica’)
    treats at length upon iron and its modifications. One passage runs:
    ‘Wrought iron may be so cast as to be made liquid and to reharden;
    and thus it is they are wont to make steel (<span lang="grc">τὸ στόμωμα</span>); for the
    scoria of iron subsides and is purged off by the bottom, and when it
    is often defæcated and cleansed, this is steel. But this they do not
    often, because of the great waste, and because it loses much weight in
    refining; but iron is so much the more excellent the more recrement
    it has.’ Daimachus, Aristotle’s contemporary, says of steels (<span lang="grc">τῶν
    στομωμάτων</span>), ‘There is the Chalybdic,<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> the Synopic, the Lydian,
    and the Lacedæmonian. The Chalybdic is best for carpenters’ tools;
    the Lacedæmonian for files, drills, gravers, and stone-chisels; the
    Lydian also is suited for files, and for knives, razors, and rasps.’
    Avicenna (Abu Ali Siná), in his fifth book, ‘De Anima,’ according to
    Roger Bacon, has three species of the metal: (1) Iron, good for hammers
    and anvils, but not for cutting tools; (2) Steel,<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> which is purer
    and has more heat <span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>in it; it is therefore less malleable, but better
    able to take an edge; and (3) Andena, ductile and malleable under a low
    degree of heat, and intermediate between iron and steel. Apparently
    the latter is the Hindiah or Hindiyáneh, the Ferrum Indicum and the
    Ondanique of Marco Polo (i. 17).</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>ROMAN IRON.</i></div>

  <p>The Romans, a more cosmopolitan people than the Greeks, paid great
    attention to the mineral wealth of their conquests, and were careful to
    choose the best <i lang="la">acies</i><a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> for their weapons. Diodorus Siculus<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a>
    describes the process by which the Celtiberians prepared their iron for
    Swords. Pliny, who was Procurator of Spain under Vespasian, may have
    studied iron-mining and ore-working in the country which still produces
    the Toledo blade. He characterises the metal generally as being
    universally used and occurring in every part of the world—especially
    in Ilva, now Elba, where there are mines of oligiste, specular iron
    or iron glance. His process of steel-making is that of the Greeks.
    ‘Fornacum maxima differentia est; in eis equidem nucleus ferri’
    (the <span lang="grc">σίδηρος ἐργασμένος</span> or worked iron of Aristotle) ‘<span lang="la">excoquitur ad
    indurandum; aliter alioque modo ad densandas incudes, malleorumve
    rostra</span>’ (xxxiv. 41). Hence it appears that the Romans had one way
    to make steel, and another to harden and temper tools, picks, and
    anvils. ‘Possibly,’ says Dr. Martin Lister, ‘the latter were boiled in
    “sow-metal,” as the term <i lang="la">densare</i> seems to suggest.’</p>

  <p>Roman mining-operations were often conducted on a large scale. The
    Forest of Dean and the Wealds of Kent and Sussex, not to mention
    other parts of England, show heaps of old slag containing classical
    pottery and coins of Nero, Vespasian, and Diocletian. They obtained
    the regulus<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> by the direct process, and used charcoal in rude
    Catalan furnaces; the work was imperfect, and the scoriæ contain a
    large percentage of metal. Ancient adits and shafts in Shropshire<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a>
    and elsewhere have preserved the rude implements with which they made
    the natives labour in <i lang="fr">corvée</i>. The hill-sides of Carthagena on the
    seaboard of Murcia (South-Eastern Spain) had been explored for lead and
    silver by the earliest Carthaginian colonists; and the industry was at
    its height when Nova Carthago, under Roman rule, became (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
    200) a flourishing municipium, the centre of a large population. At
    this time as many as forty thousand hands were regularly employed. In
    our seventh century the Arab invasion ruined the mines, not only of
    this district, but of every province occupied by the ‘Moors.’ About the
    mid-fifteenth century a revival was attempted; but this was checked
    at the beginning of the sixteenth, when the mines of Spanish America
    were opened: the Emperor <span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>Charles V. also would not see the soil of
    his European dominions disturbed by digging. The miners emigrated in
    mass, and New Carthage was forgotten till within the last half-century.
    According to M. Alfred Massart,<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> the ancient masses of plumbiferous
    scoriæ were large enough to pay for re-working. A superficial area
    of eight square leagues yielded some eight hundred thousand tons of
    iron-ore, of which two-thirds were ferro-manganese, and twenty thousand
    to twenty-five thousand tons of lead containing thirty thousand
    kilogrammes of silver. As regards the use of iron for many purposes by
    the ancient Britons before the Roman conquest, we may fairly, without
    attaching importance to the legend of ‘Milesius,’ believe that the
    industry may also have migrated northwards from a Spanish centre.
    Hence, Mr. Hutton, the local historian of Birmingham, believes that
    Sword-blades were made there before the landing of Julius Cæsar.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>IRON IN INDIA.</i></div>

  <p>From Assyria the use of iron would extend through Persia to India,
    to Indo-China, and to China and Japan. Professor Max Müller, as Mr.
    Day justly observes, differs with himself when he states in one
    place<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> that ‘iron was not known previously to the breaking up of
    the Aryan family’; and in another passage,<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> where we are told,
    ‘Before the separation of the Aryan race ... there can be no doubt
    that iron was known and its value appreciated.’ Here, evidently, the
    Sanskritist had changed his first opinion, because he had noticed
    that ‘Ayas’ may also mean copper or bronze. The Rig Veda mentions
    mail-coats, hatchets, and weapons of iron; but so far from assigning
    to this work the age of <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 1300, we may fairly hold that
    its present shape was assumed in the early centuries following
    Christianity. We have trustworthy notices of the metal in India only
    at the beginning of authentic history, when the acumen of the Greeks
    was applied to the gross absurdities of Hindu fable.<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> The Malli and
    Oxydracæ presented to Alexander a hundred talents’ weight of Indian
    steel (<i lang="la">ferrum candidum</i>) in wrought bars, just as Homer’s Achilles
    (‘Il.’ xxiii. 826), nearly a thousand years before, offered at the
    funeral games of Patroclus, ‘a rudely-molten mass of iron’ (<span lang="grc">σόλον
    αὐτοχόωνον</span>, self-melted?), which had been used for hurling at the
    foe by Eëtion, and which would supply the farm with metal for five
    years. The ‘bright iron’ of Ezekiel, named amongst the wares of Tyre
    (xxvii. 19) with cassia and calamus, was probably the same material.
    The Periplus mentions sideros indikos and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>stómoma (steel) as imports
    to the Abyssinian harbours. Daimachus and Pliny specify, amongst the
    dearest kinds of steel, the ferrum Indicum and the ferrum Sericum; and
    Salmasius refers to a Greek chemical treatise ‘On the Tempering (<span lang="grc">περὶ
    βαφῆς</span>) of Indian Steel.’</p>

  <p>The great iron-working age of India seems to have been in the fourth
    and fifth centuries of our era, when the blacksmiths must have been
    skilful and commanded an unlimited supply of the best metal. The Lát or
    iron-pillar of Delhi, to mention no other, is a solid shaft, showing
    that the people were unable to make a core. This simple piece of
    wrought metal, calculated to weigh seventeen tons and to contain eighty
    cubic feet of metal, measures in diameter 16·4 inches tapering to
    12·05. The height above ground is twenty-two feet, and excavations of
    twenty-six feet did not reach the base: the known length therefore is
    upwards of forty-eight feet.<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> The sundry inscriptions punched upon
    it are of very various dates: Prinsep<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> assigns our third or fourth
    century to the Nagari character in which Rajah Dhava thus ‘renowned
    it’:—</p>

  <p>‘By him who, learning the warlike preparations and entrenchments of
    his enemies with their good soldiers and allies, a monument of fame
    engraved by his Sword on their limbs, who as master of the seven
    advantages,<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> crossing over (the Indus?), so subdued the Vahlikas of
    Sindhu [N.B.: they can hardly be the ‘people of Balkh’] that even at
    this day his disciplined force and defences on the south (of the river)
    are sacredly respected by them,’ &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

  <p>Metallurgists dispute as to the way in which this huge iron rod was
    wrought. One writer,<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> however, seems to have hit upon the solution
    of the problem: ‘The column may have been forged standing, by welding
    on, one over another, thin iron plates or dires, the fire being built
    round the column as it grew; and the ground raised in a mound to keep
    the top of the column on a level with the workplace.’ Pyramid-building
    has been explained in the same way—a causeway.</p>

  <p>But the Lát is not the only marvel of Hindu metallurgy. Mr. James
    Fergusson found in the Temple of Kanaruc, or Black Pagoda of the Madras
    Presidency, beams of wrought iron about twenty-one feet in length and
    eight inches section, to strengthen the roof, which the Hindus, in
    their distrust of the arch, formed after their usual bracket-fashion.
    In the fane of Mahavellipore he discovered sockets for similar
    supports. He assigns to the Black Pagoda a date between <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>
    1236 and 1241; and to Mahavellipore any time between our tenth and
    fourteenth centuries.<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> Colonel Pearse, R.A. presented to the
    trustees of the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>British Museum a unique collection of archaic tools,
    iron and steel, gouges, spatulæ, ladles, and similar articles, dug out
    of tumuli at Wari Gaon, near Kampti. But there are no grounds whatever
    for dating them ‘about <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 1500, or the time of Moses.’</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>WOOTZ.</i></div>

  <p>The <i lang="la">ferrum Indicum</i><a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> of the Classics may still be represented by
    the famous Wootz or Wutz,<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> the ‘natural Indian steel,’ still so
    much prized for Sword-blades in Persia and Afghanistan. The specimens
    first sent in 1795 to the Royal Society of London were analysed by Mr.
    Josiah M. Heath with the results given below.<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a></p>

  <p>Colonel Yule remarks that the Wootz was, in part at least, the famous
    Indian steel, the <span lang="grc">σίδηρος Ἰνδικὸς καὶ στόμωμα</span> of the ‘Periplus,’ the
    Hunduwání of the mediæval Persian traders; the Andanicum or Ondanique
    of Marco Polo and the Alkinde of the old Spanish. In the sixteenth
    century the exportation was chiefly from Baticala in Canara. The King
    of Portugal complains (in <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1591) of the large quantities
    shipped from Chaul to be sold in the Red Sea to the Turks and on the
    African coast about Melinde.<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> And I would note that this industry
    by no means argues civilisation in India or elsewhere:<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> as Dr.
    Percy remarks, ‘The primitive method of extracting good malleable iron
    direct from the ore, which is still practised in India and in Africa,
    requires a degree of skill very inferior to that which is implied in
    the manufacture of bronze.’</p>

  <p>The system of Wootz-making, especially at Salem and in parts of Mysore,
    has <span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>been described by many writers. About a pound weight of malleable
    iron, made from magnetic ore, is placed, minutely broken and moistened,
    in a crucible of refractory clay, together with finely chopped pieces
    of wood (<i>Cassia auriculata</i>). It is packed without flux. The open pots
    are then covered with the green leaves of the <i>Asclepias gigantea</i>
    or the <i>Convolvulus lanifolius</i>, and the tops are coated over with
    wet clay, which is sun-dried to hardness. ‘Charcoal will not do as a
    substitute for the green twigs.’ Some two dozen of these cupels<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> or
    crucibles are disposed archways at the bottom of a furnace, whose blast
    is managed with bellows of bullock’s hide. The fuel is composed mostly
    of charcoal and of sun-dried <i>brattis</i> or cow-chips. After two or three
    hours’ smelting the cooled crucibles are broken up, when the regulus
    appears in the shape and size of half an egg. According to Tavernier,
    the best buttons from about Golconda were as large as a halfpenny roll,
    and sufficed to make two Sword-blades (?). These ‘cops’ are converted
    into bars by exposure for several hours to a charcoal fire not hot
    enough to melt them: they are then turned over before the blast, and
    thus the too highly carburised steel is oxidised.<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a></p>

  <p>According to Professor Oldham,<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> ‘Wootz’ is also worked in the
    Damudah Valley, at Birbhúm, Dyucha, Narayanpúr, Damrah, and Goanpúr.
    In 1852 some thirty furnaces at Dyucha reduced the ore to <i>kachhá</i> or
    pig-iron, small blooms from Catalan forges; as many more converted it
    to <i>pakká</i> (crude steel), prepared in furnaces of different kind. The
    work was done by different castes; the Hindís (Moslems) laboured at the
    rude metal, and the Hindús preferred the refining work. I have read
    that anciently a large quantity of Wootz found its way westward <i>viâ</i>
    Pesháwar.</p>

  <p>When last visiting (April 19, 1876) the Mahabaleshwar Hills near
    Bombay, I had the pleasure to meet Mr. Joyner, C.E., and with
    his assistance made personal inquiries into the process. The
    whole of the Sayhádri range (Western Ghats), and especially the
    ‘great-Might-of-Shiva’ mountains, had for many ages supplied Persia
    with the best steel. Our Government, since 1866, forbade the industry,
    as it threatened the highlands with disforesting. The ore was worked
    by the Hill-tribes, of whom the principal are the Dhánwars, Dravidians
    now speaking Hindustani.<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> Only the brickwork of their many raised
    furnaces remained. For fuel <span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>they preferred the Jumbul-wood, and
    the Anjan or iron-wood. They packed the iron and fourteen pounds of
    charcoal in layers; and, after two hours of bellows-working, the metal
    flowed into the forms. The ‘Kurs’ (bloom), five inches in diameter
    by two and a half deep, was then beaten into Táwás or plates. The
    matrix resembled the Brazilian, a poor yellow-brown limonite striping
    the mud-coloured clay; and actual testing disproved the common idea
    that the ‘watering’ of the surface is found in the metal. The Jauhar
    (‘jewel’ or ribboning) of the so-called ‘Damascus’ blade was produced
    artificially, mostly by drawing out the steel into thin ribbons which
    were piled and welded by the hammer. My friend afterwards sent me from
    India an inkstand of Mahabaleshwar iron.<a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a></p>

  <p>I could not learn from Hindus that they bury iron in the earth till the
    ‘core’ is reached. But they are well acquainted with tempering by cold
    immersion, as noticed by Salmasius (‘Exercit. Plin.’ 763): they still
    believe with Pliny, Justin, and a host of others, in ‘a Sword, the
    icebrook’s temper,’ and all hold that the hardening of metal depends
    much upon the quality of the water. They quench delicate articles in
    oil, a method also alluded to by Pliny, but they ignore his statement
    (xxviii. 41) that rust produced by goat’s blood gives a better edge
    to iron than the file. I am not aware that they have ever used for
    quenching purposes quicksilver, the best conductor of heat.</p>

  <p>In Burmah, as in India, the chief peculiarity of iron-smelting is
    the use of green-wood fuel.<a id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> Throughout the mighty ‘Hollander’
    Archipelago of the Farther East, this metal, known in former days
    only by importation, is now everywhere common. Java received the
    Egyptian arts from India, which colonised her about the beginning of
    the Christian era: the now untravelled Hindú was then a voyager and an
    explorer. Dr. Percy describes the iron-smelting of Borneo,<a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> which
    produces the Parangilang, a peculiar Sword-like weapon equally fit for
    felling trees and men.<a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> At Tahiti (Otaheiti), on the other hand,
    Captain Cook was unable to make the natives appreciate the use of metal
    till his armourer wrought an iron adze in shape like the native.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>IRON IN CHINA.</i></div>

  <p>The oldest, and indeed the only, Chinese word for iron is <span lang="zh">鐵</span>—<i>tie</i>,
    formerly pronounced <i>tit</i>. It is first mentioned among the
    tribute-articles of Yu in the Yu-Kung section of the Shoo-King,<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a>
    and the latter has been estimated to date from <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 2200–2000.
    If this be fact, hieroglyphic tablet-writing flourished amongst the
    ‘Bak’ some five hundred years before the age popularly attributed to
    the Hebrew Scriptures, and when the Greeks had not begun to form a
    nation.<a id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> <span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>Either then the Sinologues, like the Sanskritists, have
    been deluded by the artful native into admitting the preposterous
    claims to antiquity of culture always advanced by semi-barbarous
    peoples; or, what is hardly likely, China formed a centre of Turanian
    civilisation wholly independent of Egypt and Chaldæa. Indeed, there
    appears to have been some contact of ideas in the matter of writing.
    The Kemite denoted ‘man’ and ‘eye’ by copying nature; and probably the
    Chinese did the same. But the Turanian symbols have lost, by the law
    of pictorial evanescence, the original forms: ‘man’ has become <span lang="zh">人</span> =
    jin (No. 9),<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> a pair of legs; and ‘eye’ <span lang="zh">目</span> = mŭh (No. 109), looks
    as if copied from a cat. The picture-origin of the Assyrian syllabary
    has also been satisfactorily established by the Rev. W. Haughton,
    but the later forms are as degraded as in the hieratic and demotic
    Egyptian.<a id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a></p>

  <p>The passage above alluded to enumerates the articles of tribute as
    ‘musical gems-stones,’ iron, silver, steel, stones for arrow-heads, and
    sounding stones, with the skins of bears, great bears, foxes, jackals,
    and articles woven with their hair.’ Dr. Legge adds in a note: ‘By <span lang="zh">鐵</span> =
    <i>Tie</i>, we are to understand “soft iron,” and by <span lang="zh">鏤</span> = <i>Low</i> or <i>Lowe</i>,
    “hard iron” or “steel.” At the time of the Han dynasty, “iron-masters”
    (<span lang="zh">鐵宧</span>) were appointed in the several districts of the old Leangchou, to
    superintend the iron-works. Tsa’e refers to two individuals mentioned
    in the “Historical Records”; one of the surname Ch’o, (<span lang="zh">卓氏</span>), and the
    other of the surname Ch’ing (<span lang="zh">程</span>), both of this part of
    the empire, who became so wealthy by their smelting that they were
    deemed equal to princes.’ According to the Rev. Dr. Edkins, ‘with the
    exception of this passage there is probably no distinct allusion to
    iron in writings older than <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 1000;’ and his statement
    seems to establish the date of Chinese technology and civilisation.</p>

  <p>About <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 400 the celebrated author and philosopher Leih-Tze
    mentions steel, and describes the process of tempering it. In the
    ‘K’ang-hi-tse-tien’ (<span lang="zh">康熙字典</span>), better known as ‘Kanghi’s Dictionary,’
    published about <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1710, the author represents the Serican
    contemporary of Aristotle as saying that ‘a red blade will cut Hu
    (jade or nephrite) as it would cut mud.’ Mr. Day makes this to mean a
    ‘reddish-coloured blade,’ red being one of the many tints which a clean
    surface of steel acquires in the process of tempering. It certainly
    cannot refer to red-hot <span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>steel, which would make no impression upon
    pietra dura. The description of steel-making in <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 400 is
    so far complete that it names and describes the several kinds. The
    first treatment produces ‘Twan-Kang’ or ball-steel, so called from the
    rounded bloom,<a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> or ‘Kwan-Kang’ (sprinkled steel), because treated
    with cold affusion. There is also ‘Wei-Tie’ or false steel. The writer
    says: ‘When I was sent on official business to Tse-Chow and visited the
    foundries there, I understood this for the first time. Iron has steel
    within it, as meal contains vermicelli. Let it be subjected to fire a
    hundred times or more; it becomes lighter each time. If the firing be
    continued until the weight does not diminish, it is pure steel.’<a id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a></p>

  <p>About the beginning of the Christian era a tax was levied upon iron by
    the State exchequer, showing that the manufacture had become important.
    According to the Pi-tan or Pencil-Talk, written probably under the Ming
    dynasty<a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1366–1644), steel is thus made: ‘Wrought
    iron is bent or twisted up; unwrought iron (i.e. iron-ore or cast-iron)
    is thrown into it; it is covered up with mud and subjected to the
    action of fire, and afterwards to the hammer.’ This is the old and
    well-known process of steeling practised by the Greeks. Wrought iron
    was either immersed into molten cast-iron as into a bath, or it was
    heated with iron-ore and layers of charcoal-fuel covered with alternate
    strata of clay to exclude atmospheric influence, a treatment somewhat
    similar to what is still called ‘cementation.’<a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> The ore was thus
    deoxidised by contact with excess of carbon; and a molten carburet was
    the result. It is not a little curious, as Mr. Day observes, to find
    Aristotle and Lieh-Tze describing the same process about the same time.
    But I hesitate to conclude with that able writer that the fact has
    any bearing upon ‘the old doctrine of the original unity of the human
    race; each section of mankind carrying off with them that common stock
    of knowledge which the entire family possessed before separation.’
    Mr. Day, I have said, systematically opposes the ‘High Antiquity
    Theory’ (p. 208); and, though he holds to Revelation and to Biblical
    chronology, he has a curious tendency towards the mystical etymology of
    the Jacob Bryant school, and the obsolete Phallic theories revived by
    the learned and able work of the late Dr. Inman.<a id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span></p>

  <p>The Pent Saow, also attributed to the days of the Mings, speaks of
    three kinds of steel used for knives and Swords, a division which again
    reminds us of Daimachus. The first is made by adding unwrought to
    wrought iron, while the mass is subjected to the action of fire. The
    second is simply the result of repeated firings as practised in Africa.
    The third is native steel produced in the south-west at Hai-shan: ‘In
    appearance it resembles the stone called “Tsze-shih-ying” (purple stone
    efflorescence).’ It is understood that the process of manufacture is
    kept secret. The ‘Hankow-steel,’ which comes to Tien-tsin from the
    upper Yang-tse, is most prized; and commands much higher prices than
    the best imported English and Swedish; the Chinese, like the ‘Caffirs,’
    look upon these as ‘rotten iron.’</p>

  <p>China also had her ‘literary blacksmith,’ like Wieland Smith, the
    northern Dædalus. We read that Hoang-ta-tie of T’ancheu, who lived
    under the Sung, followed the craft of an ironsmith. Whenever he was
    at his work he used to call without intermission on the name of Amita
    Buddha. One day he handed to his neighbours the following verses of his
    own composing to be spread about:—</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">Ding-dong! the hammer-strokes fall long and fast,</div>
        <div class="i0">Until the iron turns to steel at last!</div>
        <div class="i0">Now shall the long long Day of Rest begin,</div>
        <div class="i0">The Land of Bliss Eternal calls me in.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">Thereupon he died. But his verses spread all over Honan, and many
    learned to call upon Buddha.</p>

  <p>The oldest Chinese iron-works were at Shansi and Chilili in the Ho
    districts, where there are inexhaustible deposits of ore and coal, and
    where the metal is worked to the present day. In 1875 Commissioner
    Li-hung-Chang, raised from the Government-General of Chilili to be
    Minister of the young King, sent Mr. James Henderson to England with
    orders to bring out the most modern appliances and apparatus for
    metal-working. It was proposed to build the new works at Tsze-Chow,
    a town two hundred miles south-west of Tien-tsin, the head-quarters
    of the Governor-General. Mr. Henderson had visited (1874) the
    establishment near Yang-Ching, Shansi, which had before been described
    by Baron von Richtofen and Dr. Williamson.<a id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> The iron ore bought
    at Ping-ding-Chow was found at the Royal School of Mines, London, to
    contain fifty per cent. of iron, loose hæmatite with little or no
    sulphur.</p>

  <p>M. Sévoz, an engineer of mines long resident in Japan, studied
    iron-working in the province of Ykouno.<a id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> He found the people
    using an imperfect Catalan <span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>method, but able to treat at once sixteen
    thousand kilogrammes of ore, and to produce blooms weighing one
    thousand three hundred kilogrammes. These huge rods were broken up
    under a hammer constructed in the style of a pile-driving ram, to which
    motion was given by a walking-wheel 11·5 mètres in diameter, mounted by
    men. The description does not promise much; but Japan, though holding
    to her ancient methods in districts unknown to Europeans, produces iron
    cheaper than the English. Of her marvellous Swords I shall treat in
    Part II.</p>

  <p>The people of Madagascar worked iron,<a id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> but their name of the
    metal is Malayan; hence Mr. Crawford traced the art back to Malacca.
    Yet the Malay did not extend it far eastwards: according to Mr. E.
    B. Tylor,<a id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> ‘In New Zealand, where there is good iron-ore, there
    was no knowledge of iron previously to the arrival of Europeans.’
    Passing over to the American continent, we find an immense industry
    of copper, but so little iron that, till late years, the indigenes
    were supposed not to have worked it. Ynka mines, however, have been
    discovered near Lake Titicaca; while excavations in the tumuli of
    the mysterious ‘Mound-builders,’ who may have attempted to reproduce
    the Egyptian Pyramid, yielded axes described to be of ‘hæmatite
    iron-ore,’ one of the easiest metals to smelt, and for that reason
    probably one of the first worked. Mr. Day, who figures one of these
    tool-weapons with the hammer-marks (p. 218), supposes it to have been
    ‘metallic iron,’ pronouncing hæmatite ‘extremely brittle and absolutely
    unforgeable.’<a id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> He quotes Mr. Charles C. Abbott,<a id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> who procured
    other specimens of aboriginal manufacture from the mounds. One hatchet
    was four and a half inches long by two broad, and nearly uniform in
    thickness, three-sixteenths of an inch; it had a well-defined edge,
    which from its slightly wavy outline and varied breadth, appeared to be
    hammered, not ground. According to Major Hotchkiss, who owned two other
    similar specimens, a series of four was found under an uprooted tree on
    an Indian trail in West Virginia.</p>

  <p>Fragments of unworked hæmatite, small and irregular, were used instead
    of flint for arrow-heads.<a id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> Mr. Abbott also notices ‘a curious form
    of “relic,” known as a “plummet,” occasionally occurring and made of
    iron ore: one specimen<a id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> “is made of iron ore ground down until it
    is almost as smooth as glass.” As such “plummets” are found in the
    Western Mounds, as well as on the surface of the ground throughout
    the Atlantic coast States, and are always polished, it seems fair
    to presume that a cutting instrument of such hard material would
    undoubtedly be polished and ground, if at the time of its manufacture
    grinding was known or <span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>practised among the aborigines in fashioning
    their various weapons and instruments.’</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>IRON IN AFRICA.</i></div>

  <p>But if the savages and barbarians of Oceania and the New World rarely
    worked iron, the contrary was the case with the equally uncivilised
    African races, negroid and negro, who, however, had the advantage of
    dwelling within importing and imitating distance of Egypt. I have
    elsewhere noticed the excellent assegai-blades of the Bantu (Kafirs);
    nor is this art confined to the southern regions.<a id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> Dr. Percy
    justly makes wrought iron the original form, which we see retained
    in the obscurer parts of Asia and Africa. The people always worked
    by the ‘direct process,’ the oldest style; which, however, is not
    wholly extinct in Europe. The art, quasi-stationary among wild men,
    treats small quantities at a time: the ‘voracious iron-works’ of which
    Evelyn first speaks, are beyond its wants. Moreover it can utilise
    only rich ores, unlike the ‘indirect process’ of producing cast-iron
    by the blast-furnace.<a id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> When the ore is nearly pure, a small
    addition of carbon would convert it into steel;<a id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> and the latter
    is so easily made, that the wild Hill-peoples of Africa and India
    produce, and have produced from time immemorial, an excellent article
    in the most primitive way. The proportion of charcoal is considerably
    increased, and the blast is applied more slowly than when wrought iron
    is required. The only apparatus wanted for the manufacture is a small
    clay furnace, four feet high by one to two broad, like that used by the
    South Africans; charcoal for fuel, and a skin with a pipe or twyers
    of refractory clay for the blast.<a id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> For the anvil a stone-slab
    suffices, and for the hammer a cube of stone with sides grooved for
    fibre-cords.</p>

  <p>The ‘Dark Continent’ is emphatically an iron-land, and all explorers
    have noticed its abundance of ore. Mungo Park<a id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> mentions the
    surface ironstone of dull red tint with greyish spots used by his
    ‘Mandingos’: Barth confirms his assertion by describing magnetic
    metal about Kuka of the Mandengas, and at Jinninau in the Kel-owi
    or Tawareh country: Durham and Clapperton, when near Murzuk, found
    kidney-shaped lumps upon the surface; and about Bilma, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>capital of the
    Tibbús, nodules of iron-ore puddinged in the red sandstones—could
    this have been laterite or volcanic mud? It was the only metal seen in
    the hills of Mandara; but the Bornuese prefer to import their supply
    from the neighbouring Sudan. Mr. Warren Edwards, who had temporary
    charge of a Niger expedition, observed the natives supporting their
    cooking-pots over the fire with fragments of surface ironstone; and
    it often struck him (as it does most men) that by some such means
    the smelting-process suggested itself. The metal is abundant in the
    Gaboon country, where the Mpangwe or Fans,<a id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> the western outliers
    of the great race, mostly cannibal, holding the heart of Africa, are
    able workers. They have a kind of ‘fleam-money,’ small iron bars
    shaped somewhat like a large lancet. I <span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>came upon the metal everywhere
    in Unyamwezi, the ‘Mountains of the Moon,’ and to this universal
    presence of ironstone—not to damp and heat—the Portuguese attribute
    the marvellous displays of electricity throughout Central Africa.
    A whole night will pass during which the thunder is never silent;
    and the lightning enables one to read small print, like an electric
    light. Captain Grant, in his ‘Walk across Africa,’ tells us that the
    people pick up walnut-sized nuggets of iron covered with dusty rust,
    and in a short time produce a spear-head that glistens like steel. My
    fellow-traveller to the Gold Coast, Captain Cameron, when crossing
    Africa, in most places found iron and iron-smelting.<a id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> In Kordofan,
    Mr. Petherick saw a rich surface oxide containing from fifty-five to
    sixty per cent. of pure metal. Livingstone remarked iron in the eastern
    regions of Angola,<a id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> and traced it up the Zambeze-line from east to
    west. Mr. C. T. Anderson describes it as occurring in large quantities,
    either of ironstone or pure in a crystallised state. Finally, good old
    Kolben mentions large iron-flakes on the surface near The Cape.</p>

  <p>But, as Colonel A. Lane Fox remarks:<a id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> ‘Simple heating is not
    sufficient for working iron: a continuous air-blast is required to
    keep the temperature at a certain height.’ It is interesting to see
    the means adopted by barbarians for procuring this necessary; and,
    having carefully studied it in various parts of Africa, I devote to it
    the remainder of this chapter. As Pliny repeats from Aristotle, ‘Libya
    always produces something new.’</p>

  <p>According to Strabo, Anacharsis<a id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> the Scythian, who flourished
    in the days of Solon (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 592), invented not only the
    anchor<a id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> and the potter’s wheel, but also the bellows. In Egypt,
    however, we find that these discoveries were already a thousand years
    old at least. The earliest appearance of the latter is the forge and
    bellows (in Egyptian ‘H’ati’), depicted on the walls of a tomb in the
    days of Thut-mes III., about <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 1500. The workman stands on
    two bags of skin, such as are still used to hold water, alternately
    weighing upon one and upon the other; he inflates them in turns by
    pulling up a cord which opens a valve, and then he closes the hole
    with his heel. The bellows have twyers, and the illustrations<a id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a>
    show a crucible and a heap of ore: while the material of the H’ati
    is indicated by its determinative, a hide with a tail. This rude
    contrivance was adopted by the Greeks and Romans: hence the ‘taurini
    folles’ of Plautus: and Virgil’s—</p>

  <p class="noindent">The wind-bag<a id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> would be made of ox-hide, of goat-skin, or
    of the spoils of smaller animals, according to the volume of draught
    required. And thus, also, would originate the bagpipe, an instrument
    common to almost all original peoples.</p>

  <p>But in the Dark Continent we find still in use an older form than that
    known to Thut-mes, and the earliest of the four several varieties.
    The late Mr. Petherick describes this rude contrivance in Kordofan:
    ‘The blast is supplied by skin bags worked by hand; these bags are
    made of skins, which are flayed by two incisions from the tail down
    to the hocks; the skin, being drawn over the body, is cut off at the
    neck, which makes the mouth of the bag. After tanning, the hind legs
    are cut off, and each side of the skin sewn on to a straight piece of
    stick; loops are placed on the outside for the fingers of the operator
    to pass through. It can be opened and closed at pleasure; the neck is
    secured to a tube of baked clay, and four men or boys seated round the
    cupola, each with a bellows of this primitive description, produce a
    blast by opening the bags when drawing them towards them, and closing
    them quickly, push them forward; by which means the compressed bags
    discharge the air through the tubes into the furnace, quick alternate
    movements of the arms of the operator producing a blast, which throws
    out a flame about a foot high from the top of the furnace; and the
    slag with the metal is allowed to collect in a hole beneath it.’
    Casalis similarly describes the Basuto bellows, and Mungo Park that of
    Mandenga-land; Browne saw it in Dár-For,<a id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> and Clapperton in Kuka
    and in the Highlands of Mandara, where the anvil was a coarse bloom of
    iron, and the hammers two lumps weighing about two pounds each. This
    is the bellows of Kathiawád<a id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> and of Kolapor in the Deccan, where
    Captain Graham notices that the <i>mús</i> or tubes for the blast are clay
    mixed with burnt and powdered flint. Mr. E. B. Tylor found it used by a
    travelling tinker at Pæstum.</p>

  <p>The second and improved variety of African bellows was described by
    myself during a visit to Yoruban Abeokuta. It deserves attention
    because it is a notable step in progress, leading to a further
    development; the troughs are a rudimentary cylinder, and the handles
    form an incipient piston.<a id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> ‘The two bags of goat-skin are made fast
    in a frame cut out of a single piece of wood; the upper part of each
    <i lang="la">follis</i> has, by way of handle, a stick two feet long, so that it can
    be worked by one man either standing or sitting. The handles are raised
    alternately by the blower, so that when one receives the air, the other
    ejects it; the form is like that used on the Gold Coast; and there is
    a perpendicular screen of dried clay through which the nozzle of the
    bellows passes, supplying a regular blast.’</p>

  <p>Evidently in this stage of the bellows, the lower halves of the
    leather bags are useless: the result would be the same if only the
    upper part of the wooden <span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>troughs were covered with skin, air-tight
    but loose enough to make play. This third step has been taken by the
    Djour (Júr) tribes of the Upper Nile, in north latitude 20°, and it is
    thus described by Mr. Petherick: ‘The blast-pipes are made as usual of
    burnt clay, and are attached to earthen vessels about eighteen inches
    in diameter and six inches in height, covered with a loose, dressed
    goat-skin, tied tightly round them and perforated with a few holes, in
    the centre of which is a loop to contain the fingers of the operator.
    A lad, sitting between two of these vessels, by a rapid alternate
    vertical motion drives a continuous current of air into the furnace.’</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>THE BELLOWS IN AFRICA.</i></div>

    <div class="caption smcap">Fig. 105.—Portable African Bellows.</div>
  </div>

  <p>This brings us to the fourth and last stage of African
    blast-improvement (fig. 105). Here the rudely-hewn wooden tube becomes
    a double-barrelled forcing-pump. The two air-vessels with their loose
    skin-coverings are attached to each base of the two central pipes that
    join into one. Such is the shape used in Madagascar, the cylinders
    being of bamboo, five feet long by two inches in diameter, and the
    piston a stick ending in a bunch of feathers.</p>

  <p>The bellows described by Dampier in Mindanao and elsewhere in the Malay
    Archipelago, is evidently borrowed from the Madagascar type; and into
    Borneo, Siam, and New Guinea a hollowed trunk takes the place of the
    bamboos. The sculptures in the Sukuh-temple of Java, attributed to
    the fifteenth century, represent smiths making Kríses (Creases), the
    bellows being worked by another man, who holds a piston upright in each
    hand. Colonel A. Lane Fox is of opinion that the sculptures ‘possibly
    point to a Hindu origin for this particular contrivance.’ I agree with
    him, but I would also trace the Asiatic article back to its old home in
    Africa—Egypt.</p>

  <p>The nature of fuel was determined by the supply of the country. That
    of Egypt probably consisted of cattle-chips, a material still used by
    the Fellahs. A later allusion to this article is found in the legend
    of ‘Wieland Smith’: he mixes iron-filings with the meal eaten by his
    geese, carefully collects the droppings, and out of them forges a blade
    which cuts a wool-flock or cleaves a man to the belt without turning
    edge.</p>

  <p>I conclude this chapter with the following table,<a id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> printed by Mr.
    Day at the end of his ‘High Antiquity of Iron and Steel.’ It gives
    at one view the languages, the characters, the phonetic values, the
    English equivalents, and the oldest known dates of the metals to which
    he refers. I differ from him in sundry points, and these I have taken
    the liberty to point out in italics.</p>

    </h2>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Having</span> now reached the early Iron Age, which ends prehistoric annals,
    it is advisable to answer the question—‘What is a Sword?’</p>

  <p>The word—a word which, strange to say, has no equivalent in French—is
    the Scandinavian Svärd (Icel. Sverð); the Danish Sværd; the Anglo-Saxon
    Sweord and Suerd; the Old German Svert, now Schwert, and the Old
    English and Scotch Swerd. The westward drift of the Egyptian Sf,
    Sefi, Sayf, Sfet, and Emsetf, gave Europe its generic term for the
    weapon.<a id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> The poetical is ‘brand’ or ‘bronde,’ from its brightness
    or burning; another name is ‘laufi,’ ‘laf,’ or ‘glaive,’ derived
    through French from the Latin <i lang="la">gladius</i>. Of especial modern forms
    there are the Espadon, the Flamberg, Flammberg, or Flamberge,<a id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> the
    Stoccado, and the Braquemart; the Rapier and the Claymore, the Skeyne
    and Tuck, the small-Sword and the fencing-foil, beside other varieties
    which will occur in the course of the following pages. ‘Sword’ includes
    ‘Sabre,’ which may also derive from the Egyptian through the Assyrian
    Sibirru and Akkadian Sibir, also written Sapara; our ‘Sabre’ is the
    Arabic Sayf with the Scandinavian terminative <i>r</i> (Sayf-r). Ménage
    would derive Sabre from the Armoric Sabrenn: Littré has the Spanish
    Sable, the Italian Sciabola, Sciabla, and in Venice Sabala, from the
    German Sable or Säbel, which again identifies with other languages, as
    the Serb Sablja and the Hungarian Száblya. The chief modern varieties
    of the curved blade are the Broadsword, the Backsword, the Hanger, and
    the Cutlass, the Scymitar and Düsack, the Yataghan and the Flissa.
    These several modifications will be considered in the order of their
    invention. Lastly the Egyptian ‘Sfet’ originated through Keltic
    the word Spata or Spatha<a id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> (Spatarius = a Swordsman) conserved
    to the present day in the neo-Latin names of the straight foining
    weapon—espada, espé, espée, épée.</p>

  <p>Physically considered, the Sword is a metal blade intended for cutting,
    thrusting, or cut-and-thrust (<i lang="fr">fil et pointe</i>). It is usually, but not
    always, composed of two <span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>parts. The first and principal is the blade
    proper (<i>la lame</i>, <i>la lama</i>, <i>die Klinge</i>). Its cutting surface is
    called the edge (<i>le fil</i>, <i>il filo</i>, <i>die Schärfe</i>),<a id="FNanchor_430" href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> and its
    thrusting end is the point (<i>la pointe</i>, <i>la punta</i>, <i>die Spitze</i> or
    <i>der Ort</i>, the latter mostly opposed to the <i>Mund</i> or sheath-mouth).</p>

  <p>The second part, which adapts the weapon for readier use, is the hilt,
    hilts or heft (<i>la manche</i>, <i>la manica</i>, <i>die Hilse</i> or <i>das Heft</i>),
    whose several sections form a complicated and a prodigiously varied
    whole. The grip is the outer case of the tang, <i>alias</i> the tongue (<i>la
    soie</i>, <i>la spina</i>, or <i>il codolo</i>; <i>der Stoss</i>, <i>die Angel</i>, <i>die
    Griffzunge</i> or <i>der Dorn</i>), the thin spike which projects from the
    shoulders or thickening of the blade (<i>le talon</i> or <i>l’épaulement</i>,
    <i>il talone</i>, <i>der Ansatz</i> or <i>die Schulter</i>) at the end opposed to the
    point. Sometimes there are two short teeth or projections from the
    angles of the shoulders, and these are called ‘the ears’ in English, in
    German, and in the neo-Latin tongues.</p>

  <p>The tang, which is of many shapes—long and short, straight-lined or
    curvilinear, plain or pierced for attachment—ends in the pommel or
    ‘little apple’ (<i>le pommeau</i>, <i>il pomolo</i>, <i>der Knauf</i> or <i>Knopf</i>),
    into which it should be made fast by rivets or screws. The object of
    this globe, lozenge, or oval of metal is to counterpoise the weight of
    the blade, to prop the ferient of the hand, and to allow of artistic
    ornamentation. The grip of wood, bone, horn, ivory, metal, valuable
    stones, and other materials, covered with skin, cloth, and various
    substances, whipped round with cord or wire, is protected at the
    end abutting upon the ‘chape’<a id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> or guard proper (<i>la garde</i>, <i>la
    guardia</i>, <i>die Parirstangen</i>, <i>die Leiste</i> or <i>die Stichblätter</i>)
    by the hilt-piece, which also greatly varies. It may, however, be
    reduced to two chief types—the guard against the thrust, and the guard
    against the cut. The former was originally a plate of metal, flat or
    curved, circular or oval, affixed to the bottom of the hilt, dividing
    the shoulders from the tang: in fact, it was a shield in miniature
    (<i>la coquille</i>, <i>la coccia</i>, <i>das Stichblatt</i>). We still use the term
    ‘basket-hilt,’ and apply ‘shell’ (<i>la coque</i>, <i>la coccia</i>, <i>der Korb</i>
    or <i>die Schale</i>) to the semicircular hilt-guards—mostly of worked,
    chased, embossed, or pierced steel—which appear to perfection in the
    Spanish and Italian rapiers of the sixteenth century. This hilt-plate
    has dwindled in the French fencing-foil to a lunette, a double oval
    of bars shaped like a pair of spectacles. In the Italian foil, which
    preserves the plate, the section of the blade between that and the
    grip is called <span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>the <i>Ricasso</i> (<i>a</i>); the parallel bar is the <i>Vette
    traversale</i> (<i>b</i>, <i>b</i>); and the two are connected by the <i lang="it">archetti d’
    unione</i> (joining bows, <i>c</i>, <i>c</i>).</p>

    <div class="caption smcap">Fig. 106.—The Italian Foil.</div>
  </div>

  <p>The guard against the cut is technically called the cross-guard (<i lang="fr">les
    quillons</i>,<a id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> <i>le vette</i>, <i>die Stichblätter</i>). This section is
    composed of one or more bars projecting from the hilt between tang
    and blade, and receiving the edge of the adversary’s weapon should it
    happen to glance or to glide downwards. The quillons may be either
    straight (fig. 109)—that is, disposed at right angles—or curved
    (fig. 107). When the two horns bend down from the handle-base towards
    the point they are called <i lang="fr">à antennes</i>. Others are turned up towards
    the hilt, counter-curved or inversed—that is, faced in opposite
    directions—or fantastically deformed (fig. 110).</p>

  <p>Opposed to the guard proper is the bow or counterguard (<i>la
    contregarde</i>, <i>l’elsa</i>, <i>la contraguardia</i>, <i>der Bügel</i>). It is of two
    chief kinds. In the first the quillons are recurved towards the pommel:
    the second is a bar or system of bars connecting the pommel with the
    quillons (fig. 108). The former defends the fingers, the latter serves
    to protect, especially from the cut, the back of the hand and the outer
    wrist. This modification, unknown to the ancients of Europe, became a
    favourite in the sixteenth century, and it is still found in most of
    our actual hilts. Another product of the early modern age is the <i>pas
    d’âne</i>.<a id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> At the end of the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>fourteenth century it was composed of
    two circular or oval-shaped bars, disposed on both sides of, and partly
    over, the fort of the blade. In the sixteenth century it was generally
    adopted, and became a complicated and highly-decorated adjunct to the
    handle. The <i>pas d’âne</i> is now almost obsolete: a relic remains in our
    army-claymore.<a id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a></p>

  <p>We may divide the shapes of blade into two typical forms with their
    minor varieties:</p>

  <p class="mb0">I. The curved blade (sabre, shable, broadsword, backsword, cutlass,
    hanger, scymitar,<a id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> Düsack, Yataghan, Flissa, &amp;c.) is</p>

  <ol class="alpha">
    <li><i>a.</i> Edged on both sides (Abyssinian).</li>
    <li><i>b.</i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; „&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;concave side (old Greek, Kukkri).</li>
    <li><i>c.</i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; „&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;convex (common sabre).</li>
  </ol>

  <p class="mb0">II. The straight blade (Espadon, Flammberg, Stoccado, Braquemart,
    rapier, claymore, skeyne, tuck, small-sword, &amp;c.): the varieties are:</p>

  <ol class="alpha">
    <li><i>a.</i> The cut-and-thrust, one- or two-handed.</li>
    <li><i>b.</i> The broad and unpointed (headman’s instrument).</li>
    <li><i>c.</i> The narrow, used only for the point.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>It is hardly advisable to make a third type of the half-curved blade,
    adapted equally for <i lang="fr">tac et taille</i> (cutting and thrusting), which we
    find in ancient Assyria, in India, and in Japan. It evidently connects
    both shapes.</p>

  <p>The following diagram shows the three forms:<a id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a></p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <a id="f111"><img src="images/i_126_f111.jpg" width="412" height="70" alt="" /></a>
    <div class="caption smcap">Fig. 111.</div>
  </div>

  <p>I have given precedence to the curved blade because cutting is more
    familiar to man than thrusting. Human nature strikes ‘rounders’ until
    severe training teaches it to hit out straight from the shoulder.
    Again, the sabre-form would naturally be assumed by the sharpened
    club during the wooden age of imperfect edges; and the penetrating
    power would be weak and almost <i>nil</i> when the point was merely a
    fire-hardened stick.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span></p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>CUT AND THRUST.</i></div>

  <p>Yet there is no question of superiority between the thrust and the
    cut. As the diagram<a id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> shows, <span class="smcap">A</span>, who delivers point, has
    an advantage in time and distance over <span class="smcap">B</span>, who uses edge.
    Indeed, the man who first ‘gave point’ made a discovery which more than
    doubled the capability of his weapon. Vegetius tells us that the Roman
    victories were owing to the use of the point rather than the cut: ‘When
    cutting, the right arm and flank are exposed, whereas during the thrust
    the body is guarded, and the adversary is wounded before he perceives
    it.’ Even now it is remarked in hospitals that punctured wounds in the
    thorax or abdomen generally kill, while the severest incisions often
    heal. Hence Napoleon Buonaparte, at Aspronne, ordered the cavalry of
    the Guard to give point. General Lamoricière, a scientific soldier,
    recommended for cavalry a cylindrical blade, necessarily without edge,
    and to be used only for the thrust: practical considerations, however,
    prevented its adoption. Moreover, the history of the ‘white arm’ tells
    us that the point led to the guard or parry proper, and this ‘defence
    with the weapon of offence’ completed the idea of the Sword as now
    understood in Europe.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <a id="f112"><img src="images/i_127_f112.jpg" width="347" height="178" alt="" /></a>
    <div class="caption smcap">Fig. 112.</div>
  </div>

  <p>Again, the peoples who fought from chariots and horseback—Egyptians,
    Assyrians, Indians, Tartars, Mongols, Turks, and their brethren the
    ‘white Turks’ (Magyars or Hungarians), Sarmatians, and Slavs—preferred
    for the best of reasons the curved type. The straight Sword, used only
    for thrusting, is hard to handle when the horse moves swiftly; and the
    broad straight blade loses its value by the length of the plane along
    which it has to travel. On the other hand, the bent blade collects,
    like the battle-axe, all the momentum at the ‘half-weak,’ or centre
    of percussion, where the curve is greatest. Lastly, the ‘drawing-cut’
    would be easier to the mounted man, and would most injure his enemy.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the peoples of southern latitudes—for instance,
    those dwelling around the Mediterranean, the focus of early
    civilisation, where the Sword has ever played its most brilliant
    and commanding part—are active and agile races of light build and
    comparatively small muscular power. Consequently they have generally
    preferred, and still prefer, the pointed weapon, whose deadly <span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>thrust
    can be delivered without requiring strength and weight. For the inverse
    reason the sons of the north would choose the Espadon proper, the
    long, straight, ponderous, two-edged blade which suited their superior
    stature and power of momentum.</p>

  <p>Such is the geographical and ethnological view of Sword-distribution,
    but it gives a rule so general that a multitude of exceptions must
    be expected. As far as we know, the civilised Sword originated in
    Egypt, but it had many different centres of development. A gradual and
    continuous progress can be traced in its history till it was superseded
    by an even older form of attack—the ‘ballistic.’ Yet some of the
    earliest blades show the best forms, and the line of advancement at
    times becomes distorted or even broken. Again, many Southrons, and
    races that fought on foot, have used the curved weapon, although the
    converse, the adoption of the straight, pointed Sword by horsemen, is
    comparatively rare.</p>

  <p>I now proceed to consider various points connected with the curved and
    straight forms of blade. The experience of the Sword-cutter has noticed
    that the shape of any pattern or model, whether of tool or of weapon,
    suggests its own and only purpose. This is what we should expect. A
    swordsman chooses his Sword as a sawyer his saw. Show the mechanic a
    new chisel, and its form at once explains to him its use: he learns by
    the general shape, the edge-angle, the temper, the weight, and similar
    considerations, that it is <em>not</em> made to drive nails, nor to bore
    holes, and that it is intended to cut wood or soft substances. Thus,
    too, the form of the Sword is determined by the duty expected of it.</p>

  <p>The Sword has three main uses, cutting, thrusting, and guarding. If
    these qualifications could be combined, there would be no difficulty in
    determining the single best shape. But unfortunately—perhaps I should
    say fortunately—each requisite interferes to a great extent with the
    other. Hence the various modifications adopted by different peoples,
    and hence the successive steps of progress.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>THE CENTRE OF PERCUSSION.</i></div>

  <p>The simplest and most effective form of trenchant instrument intended
    for cutting only is the American broad-axe used by squatters in the
    backwoods. This revival of the proto-historic celt and headman’s
    instrument is a plain, heavy wedge of steel, fixed on a light, tough
    wooden helve or heft, thus concentrating all the force in the head that
    strikes the blow. Here there is no uncertainty about the use; and, were
    it not necessary in swordsmanship to ‘recover guard’ and to save self
    as well as disable the assailant, it would be the best, as it is one of
    the oldest, weapons derived from the club. But the cutting Sword, which
    in the short curved form is its congener, has a long blade that allows
    a choice of cut—a good choice and a bad choice. If the blow be made,
    for instance, at a tree-branch with the Sword-point (the ‘whole-weak’),
    its sole effect will be to jar wrist and arm unpleasantly. The same
    result will follow a blow with the ‘whole-strong.’ In either case the
    vibration of the blade shows a waste of strength. By the experiment
    of cutting along the entire length, inch after inch, and by comparing
    the effect, the swordsman comes at last to a point, about the end of
    the ‘half-weak,’ speaking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span> roughly, where there is no jar, and where,
    consequently, the whole force of the blow becomes effective. But
    our ‘centre of percussion’ must not be confounded with the ‘centre
    of gravity.’ This balance-position is situated in the middle of the
    ‘whole-strong,’ the proper part for guarding, and for guarding only.</p>

  <p>The late Mr. Henry Wilkinson, of London, a practical man of science,
    first proposed a formula for determining the centre of percussion
    without the tedious process of experimenting with each and every blade.
    His system was based upon the properties of the pendulum. A light rod,
    exactly 39·2 inches long, capped with a heavy leaden ball, and swung
    to and fro upon a fixed centre, vibrates seconds or sixty times per
    minute in the latitude of London, and the three centres of percussion,
    of oscillation, and of gravity are concentrated within the ball. If
    it were a mathematical pendulum—a rod without weight—these three
    points would lie precisely in the core of the ball, or 39·2 inches from
    the place of suspension. The blade, to be graduated, is suspended,
    tight-fastened at the point on which it would turn when making a cut,
    and is converted by swinging into a pendulum. As the length is shorter,
    so the oscillations are quicker: the blade makes eighty movements to
    sixty of the pendulum. A simple formula determines the length of such
    an eighty-vibrations pendulum to be twenty-two inches. This distance,
    measured from the point at which the blade was suspended, is marked on
    the back as the centre of percussion, where there is no jar, and where
    the most effective cut can be delivered.</p>

  <p>Again, an examination of the axe shows that the cutting edge lies
    considerably in advance of the wrist and hand, with the effect of
    carrying the edge well forward on the ‘line of direction,’ which, in
    the Sword, passes directly from pommel to point. If the edge were at
    the back the tendency of the weapon would be to fall away from the
    line of cut, and this could be overcome only by a certain amount of
    wasted force. In nearly all curved Swords, except the Japanese, some
    contrivance is made to give the feeling which we express by ‘the edge
    leading well forward’; and this point has been carefully studied by
    nations whose attack is the cut. Usually the line of hilt is thrown
    forward so as to form an angle with the axis of the blade, and the
    former is made obtuser or acuter in proportion as the latter is more or
    less curved. By balancing the weapon upon the pommel the effect becomes
    evident; the edge falls forward like that of the axe.</p>

  <p>The superiority of the curved blade for cutting purposes is easily
    proved. In every cut the edge meets its object at some angle, and the
    penetrating portion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span> becomes a wedge. But this wedge is not disposed
    at right angles with the Sword: the angle is more or less oblique
    according to the curvature, and consequently it cuts with an acuter
    edge. The accompanying figures of a ‘scymitar’ and a claymore, both
    trenchant blades, prove that, were the edge to describe a right line
    (<span class="smcap">A B</span>) directed at any object (<span class="smcap">C</span>), it would act as a
    wedge (<span class="smcap">D</span>), measuring exactly the breadth of the blade. But the
    curve throws the edge more forward, and thus the ‘half-weak’ acts like
    a wedge (<span class="smcap">E</span>), which is longer and consequently more acute, the
    extreme thickness (that of the back or base) being a fixed measure.
    Similarly, by cutting still nearer the ‘weak’ or point, the increased
    curvature gives a more prolonged and acuter cuneiform (<span class="smcap">F</span>).
    Comparing the three sections of the same blade (<span class="smcap">D E F</span>), which
    differ only in the angle at which the edge is supposed to meet the
    obstacle, we see the enormous gain of cutting power.</p>

  <p>The difference between the direct and the oblique cut is still better
    shown by the annexed diagram: ‘Let <span class="smcap">A B C D</span> (fig. 116)
    represent the portion of a Sword-blade, of which <span class="smcap">A B</span> is the
    edge and <span class="smcap">C D</span> the back, measuring about one-eighth of an inch
    in thickness. Now, if the object to be cut through is presented to the
    blade at right angles to the edge, as shown by arrow No. 1, then the
    section of the blade with which the cut is to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span> effected will be
    as represented in the triangular section <span class="smcap">F E G</span> (fig. 117).
    But if the object be presented to the blade obliquely, as shown by
    arrow No. 2, then the section along the line of the cut will be as
    represented by the angle <span class="smcap">C E K</span>. It will readily be seen that
    in the latter case the acuteness of the angle at <span class="smcap">E</span> is greatly
    increased, whilst the substance is the same as in the other case. To
    effect this it is the custom in many parts of the East to strike with
    a drawing cut, but the same purpose is secured by bending the blade
    backwards: the curve itself presents the edge obliquely to the object
    without entailing the necessity of imparting a drawing motion to the
    stroke.’<a id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a></p>

  <p><i lang="fr">Par parenthèse</i>, it is this drawing motion which, added to the curve
    of the weapon and its oblique presentation, increases the trenchant
    power. The ‘Talwár,’ or half-curved sabre of Hindustan, cuts as though
    it were four times as broad and only one-fourth the thickness of the
    straight blade. But the ‘drawing-cut’ has the additional advantage of
    deepening the wound and of cutting into the bone. Hence men of inferior
    strength and stature used their blades in a manner that not a little
    astonished and disgusted our soldiers in the Sind and Sikh campaigns.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>SECTIONS OF SWORD-BLADES.</i></div>

  <p>If we consider the sections of cutting weapons, we find them all
    modifications of that most ancient mechanical contrivance, the wedge,
    as shown by the following figures:</p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <a id="f118"><img src="images/i_131_f118.jpg" width="401" height="267" alt="" /></a>
    <div class="caption smcap">Fig. 118.—Sections of Sword-Blades.</div>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">The first form (fig. 118) is the wedge that would be produced
    by taking for base the dorsal thickness of an ordinary blade, and by
    continuing it in an even line to the apex of the triangle—the point.
    The two sides meet at an angle of nine degrees; consequently the edge
    lacks the thickness, weight, and strength necessary for every cutting
    tool. For soft substances it should range from ten to twenty <span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>degrees,
    as in the common dinner knife. An angle of twenty-five to thirty-five
    degrees, being the best for wood-working, is found in the carpenter’s
    plane and chisel. For cutting bone the obtuseness rises to forty
    degrees, and even to ninety; the latter being the fittest for shearing
    metals, and the former for Sword-blades, which must expect to meet with
    hard substances. But even an angle of forty degrees will be ineffectual
    upon a thick head, unless the cut be absolutely true. No. 2 illustrates
    the angle of resistance (forty degrees) and the entering angle (ninety
    degrees). No. 3 shows that the true wedge of forty degrees is too thick
    and heavy for use, requiring some contrivance for lightening the blade,
    while preserving the necessary angle of resistance. The remaining
    sections display the principal modes of effecting this object. In
    Nos. 4 and 6 the angle is carried in a curved and bulging line, thus
    giving the section a bi-convex form. When the back or base is flat
    this is the Persian and Khorásáni, vulgarly called the ‘Damascus
    blade.’ When baseless and two-edged it is the old ‘Toledo’ rapier—two
    shallow-crowned arches meeting (3<i>a</i>, fig. 124). In both cases the
    weapon is strong, but somewhat overweighted. In the next shapes (Nos.
    5 and 7), the two sides are cut away to a flat surface and represent
    the ‘Talwár’ of India. When this flat surface is hollowed, as by the
    black lines of No. 5 (compare No. 8), we have the bi-concave section,
    as opposed to the bi-convex. This hollowing of the wedge into two broad
    grooves from the angle of resistance is one of the forms assumed by the
    English ‘regulation’ Sword: it was considered the lightest for a given
    breadth and thickness, but it is by no means the strongest, and there
    are sundry technical objections to it.</p>

  <p>The remaining blades in the illustration are grooved in as many
    different ways. The function of the <i>cannelure</i> is to obviate
    over-flexibility; it also takes from the weight and adds to the
    strength. By channelling either side of a thin or ‘whippy’ blade
    it becomes stiffer, because any force applied to bend such a blade
    sideways meets with the greatest amount of resistance that form can
    supply. Mechanically speaking, it is to crush an arch inwards upon its
    crown, and the deeper the arch the greater the resistance. Hence the
    narrow groove is preferable to a broader channel of the same depth. No.
    9, hollowed on each side near the base, is a good old form, superior
    to the ‘regulation’ (No. 8): its weak point, the space between the
    grooves where the metal is thinnest, lies in the best place—near the
    back, where strength and thickness are least required. No. 10, though
    somewhat lighter, doubles its weak points. No. 11 is better in this
    respect: it has three grooves which are far shallower, and consequently
    the metal between them is thicker. The same remark applies to Nos. 12
    and 13, which are sections of claymores, single- and treble-grooved.</p>

  <p>No. 14 shows an ingenious method of obviating the weakness caused by
    deep <i>cannelures</i>: it is the section of a blade made at Klingenthal
    (not ‘Klegenthal’), the Sword manufactory established by Napoleon
    Buonaparte in Elsass-Lothringen. Two very marked grooves are cut in the
    metal, but not directly opposite each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span> other, and thus the channels can
    touch and even overlap the axial line. This disposition gives great
    stiffness, but, as testing shows, the edge is deficient in cutting
    power, probably from loss of force by vibration.</p>

  <p>Nos. 15 and 16 are experimental blades. The former has the groove
    placed in the base, preserving the wedge-sides intact; but there is
    great difficulty about grinding this shape, and, the resistance of the
    arch-crown being wanting, there is a small increase of stiffening—the
    Sword, in fact, ‘springs’ almost as readily as the straight form.
    No. 16 has some good points, but, on the whole, the combination is a
    failure. Lastly, No. 17, the old ‘ramrod-back’ regulation blade, is
    perhaps the worst of all: the sudden change from the thick round base
    to the thin sharp edge makes an equal tempering very difficult, and the
    weapon cleverly undoes its own work, the base acting as check or stop
    to the cut.</p>

    </div>

  <p>Remains now to consider the Sword as a weapon for point, a use to
    which, as its various shapes show, it was applied in the earliest ages
    instinctively, as it were, before Science taught the superiority of the
    thrust to the cut. We learn from such hand-thrusting instruments—the
    awl, gimlet, needle, and dinner-fork—that the straight weapon
    may be considered a very acute wedge with a method of progression
    mostly oblique. It is easy to prove that the proper shape for a
    thrusting-blade is pre-eminently the straight. Fig. 119 shows the foil
    making a hole exactly its own size. The ‘regulation’ Sword (fig. 120),
    a shallow curve, opens, when moving in a direct line, about double its
    own width; a figure which the scymitar (fig. 121) increases to five or
    six times, with a proportionate loss of depth at the same expenditure
    of force. This augmented resistance to penetration is one, but only
    one, of the many difficulties in using a curved blade for a straight
    thrust.</p>

  <p>This difficulty probably suggested the ‘curved thrust’ method of
    pointing which the foil, as opposed to the rapier, has made popular.
    The point is propelled, not in a straight line, but in the arc of a
    circle more or less curved to correspond<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span> with the blade. The arm makes
    this cycloidal movement readily enough, but under a disadvantage; as in
    the cut the space traversed is longer than what is absolutely necessary
    to reach the object. Moreover, the movement cannot well be applied to
    the lunge, so as to throw the weight of the body into the attack. Like
    the ‘thrusting-cut,’ it is more fitted for horseback than for foot.
    Although doubtless the best way of pointing with a curvilinear blade,
    in no case is it better than the straight thrust.</p>

  <p>The ‘curved thrust’ so imposed upon Colonel Marey, of the French army,
    that he proposed in an elaborate work on Swords (Strasburg, 1841) to
    adopt the Yataghan, whose beautifully curved line of blade coincides
    accurately with the motion of the wrist in cutting, and which he
    held to be equally valuable for the point. As a regulation Sword for
    infantry, it was spoilt by a cheap iron scabbard. As a bayonet it lost
    all its distinctive excellence: the forward weight, so valuable in
    cutting with the hand, made it heavy and unmanageable at the end of a
    musket, and none but the strongest arms could use it, especially when
    the thrust had to be ‘lanced out.’ Yet it lasted for a quarter of a
    century, and only in 1875 it was superseded by the triangular weapon
    attached to the <i>fusil Gras</i>.<a id="FNanchor_439" href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a></p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>SECTIONS OF THRUSTING-SWORDS.</i></div>

  <p>Fig. 124 shows sections of the principal forms of thrusting blades.
    No. 1, whose section, a lozenge, is nearly square, consists of two
    obtuse-angled wedges joined at the bases, making a strong, stiff,
    and lasting, but very heavy, Sword. This form dates from the earliest
    times: we find it in the bronze rapiers of France and England, and it
    was preserved in many of the Toledan, Bilbao, Zaragosan, Solingen, and
    Italian rapiers; it is known to English armourers as the ‘Saxon,’ <span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>and
    to workmen as the ‘latchen’-blade. Nos. 2 and 3 show two simple methods
    of lightening it, the former carrying down the axis a fore-and-aft
    groove instead of the raised mid-rib on either face, which was used in
    the days of the Trojan war. No. 4 is the so-called ‘Biscayan’ shape,
    the <i>trialamellum</i> of more ancient days, with three deep grooves and
    as many blunt edges, by which the parries were made. Theoretically
    it is good: practically and technically speaking, it is inferior to
    either of the preceding. There is so much difficulty in making the
    blade straight and of even temper that many professional men have
    never seen one which was not either crooked or soft. Yet this is the
    ‘small-Sword’ proper, the duelling weapon of the last century, which
    stood its ground as far as the first quarter of the present century.
    It had a curious modification—the Colichemarde blade, so called from
    its inventor, Count Königsmark. This was a trialamellum very wide and
    heavy in the ‘whole-strong’ quarter near the hilt, and at about eight
    inches suddenly passing to a light and slender rapier-section. It
    was invented about 1680, and became a favourite duelling-blade, the
    feather-weight at the point making it the best of fencing weapons. It
    remained in fashion during the reign of Louis XIV. and then suddenly
    disappeared.<a id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a></p>

  </div>

  <p>The small-Sword was introduced into England during the eighteenth
    century, and only after 1789 it ceased to be the almost universal
    French weapon in affairs of honour. I believe that the change to the
    <i lang="fr">épée de combat</i> and the foil arose from the popular prejudice that
    the triangular blade is too dangerous for fair duelling, and that a
    body-wound with it bleeds inwardly and is almost always fatal. This
    ‘small-Sword,’<a id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> however, left its descendant in our old bayonet,
    the grooves being shallower and the ribs raised higher. No. 6, supposed
    to be an experimental Sword from the Klingenthal manufactory, dated
    1810–14, is a curious attempt to add cutting power <span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>to a quadrangular
    thrusting blade; but, as the angles are very acute, the blow will have
    hardly any effect. No. 7 is an improvement upon the latter, because it
    has more trenchant capacity. The defect of both these Swords is that
    they have a tendency to turn over in the hand, and to ‘spring’ at the
    flat side when the point meets with the least resistance.</p>

  <p>There are other ways of lightening the blade besides grooving. A
    favourite fashion in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the golden
    age of the Sword, was to break the continuity by open work, which
    allowed free play to the ornamenter’s hand. It was also supposed
    to render the wound more dangerous by admitting the air. As will
    afterwards be shown, certain Eastern and mediæval sabres were hollowed
    to contain sections or pennations, which sprang out in small lateral
    blades when a spring was touched. A German <i>main-gauche</i> in the Musée
    d’Artillerie, Paris (No. J. 485), shows three blades expanding by a
    spring when a button is pressed in the handle, and forming a guard of
    great length and breadth, in which the opponent’s Sword might be caught
    and snapped. Another rare form was the ‘Paternoster blade,’ fitted with
    round depressions, which enabled the pious to count the number of his
    ‘vain repetitions,’ even in the dark (fig. 129).</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span></p>

  <p>It has been shown that the material determines the obtuseness or
    acuteness of the angle formed by the two planes which meet at the apex
    to form the edge. There are many varieties of the <i>fil</i>. The edge
    proper <span class="large helv"><b>V</b></span>, formed by the angles of resistance (forty degrees)
    and of entrance (ninety degrees), has already been noticed. Besides
    this there are the chisel-edge, mostly applied to tools such as the
    plane; and lastly bevel-edge, or double-slope,
    <img class="iglyph-4" src="images/i_137_s.png" alt="" width="21" height="20" />, which

  <div class="sidenote"><i>OF THE EDGE.</i></div>

  <p>In the Sword the edge is usually straight. The principal exceptions are
    the following. The wavy, cutting surface appears in the ‘flamberge,’
    to which flame gave a name<a id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a>: it is nowhere better developed than
    in the beautiful Malay krís (crease). The object seems to be that of
    increasing the cutting surface. The wave-edged form is well shown
    in an iron dagger (end of fourteenth or early fifteenth century) of
    the Nieuwerkerke Collection: similar weapons, taken from the Thames,
    are found in the British Museum, and they abound in Continental
    collections. Often the waves are broken into saw-teeth: this apparently
    silly contrivance is found on a large scale in Indian sabres; its
    latter appearance farther west is on the precious saw-bayonet, a
    theoretical <i lang="la">multum in parvo</i> equally useless for flesh and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>fuel. Of
    somewhat similar kind is the toothed edge, which is found in Arab,
    Indian, and other Eastern weapons. The deepest indentations are in
    the so-called Sword-breakers (<i>brise-épées</i>), mostly of the fifteenth
    century. It is not easy to explain, except by individual freak, the
    meaning of the toothed or broken edge which appears in a dagger of
    the fourteenth century (fig. 137). Lastly, there is the hooked-edge,
    spur-edge, or prong-edge, whose projections are generally found in the
    flammberg (flamberge) proper, or two-handed Sword of wavy contour.
    The hooks are either single or double, and the evident intention
    was to receive the adversary’s blade. As a rule the hollow of the
    half-crescent is towards the point: some project horizontally, but very
    few are reversed or hollow towards the hilt, as that shape would lead
    the adversary’s blade to the forearm.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>OF THE POINT.</i></div>

  <p>The point again differs as much as the edge. The natural point would be
    the prolongation and gradual convergence of various lines of the solid
    body, conical, pyramidal, or polygonal, concurring in a common apex. In
    the Japanese blade the edge-line is bent upwards to meet the back-line.
    When more strength is wanted the end is bevelled, forming, like the
    edge, a compound angle between forty and ninety degrees: it is thus
    fitted to meet hard bodies, and the obtuser the angle the stronger the
    point.</p>

  <p>When edge only is regarded, as in the Schläger and the glaive, the
    Sword of justice or the Scharfrichter’s (headman’s) weapon, the point
    of the very broad thin blade is rounded off. This, as will be seen,
    is the case with the early Kelto-Scandinavian Swords, miscalled
    Anglo-Saxon.</p>

  <p>There is more variety in the extremities of cutting-blades. The
    falchion of Ashanti, Dahome, and Benin, the murderous despotisms of
    western intertropical Africa, terminates in a whorl. This is also the
    shape of the Chinese sabre-knife, with which criminals were despatched.
    The old Persian Sword, often called by mistake the Turkish Sword, ends
    in a point beyond a broadening of the blade. The effect is to add
    force to the cut; the weapon becomes top-heavy, but that is of little
    consequence when only a single slash, and no guarding, is required
    of it. This peculiarity was curiously developed in the true Turkish
    scymitar, which we see in every picture of the sixteenth century,
    and which has now become so rare in our museums. The end gradually
    developed to a monstrous size; the length was cut down for the sake of
    handiness and the guard was almost abolished, because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span> parrying was the
    work of the shield. This exceptional form extended far eastwards and
    westwards. Some of the Nepaul Swords have a double wave at the end.
    It was adopted by the Chinese, who, as usual in their arms, reduced
    it to its simplest expression: the pommel is cap-shaped, the handle
    corded, and the guard a small oval of metal insufficient to protect
    the hand (fig. 145). Another good specimen of the ‘Turanian blade’ is
    the formidable Dáo<a id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> of the Nágá tribe, south-east of Assam. It is
    a thick, heavy backsword, eighteen inches long, with a bevel where the
    point should be, worn at the waist in a half-scabbard of wood, and
    used for digging as well as killing. The Turkish form also extended to
    Europe and America, where it became one of the multitudinous varieties
    of the ‘mariner’s cutlass,’ from ‘curtle-axe’—<i>curtus</i> and axe. The
    ‘Turanian blade’ is well shown in Eastern scutcheons.<a id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> Its shape
    resembles that of a hunter’s horn with a Sword-knot hanging in two
    ribbons, a survival from remote antiquity. The tincts are purpure,
    gules and sable, upon a fasce tenné (‘on a fess’ or bar) or, vert and
    argent. The descriptions are very precise and technical; for instance,
    Abu <span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>el-Mahásin thus notices the Rank (armorial badges) of Anuk, son of
    Abdullah el-Ashraty: ‘The coat was composed of a circle argent cut by a
    bar vert, upon which was charged a Sword gules.... This Rank was very
    pleasing, and the women of the town had it tattooed upon their wrists.’
    The Rank was given when a subject was raised to the dignity of Amir.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>CHELIDONIAN BLADES.</i></div>

  <p>Before ending the subject of the point I must briefly notice the forked
    or swallow-tailed blade, a curious subject deserving an exhaustive
    monograph. The Greeks evidently derived their <span lang="grc">χελιδὼν</span> or <span lang="grc">χελιδόνιος
    ξίφος</span>,<a id="FNanchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> and the Latins their <i>bidens</i>, from the two-ended chisels
    so common in Egypt. As will be seen, there was a true forked Sword in
    Assyria, and the form is commonly found in Indian daggers.</p>

  <p>The Chelidonian sabre has two distinct shapes. In one the plates are
    welded together, and separate at the third or the fourth section near
    the end. Mr. Latham (Wilkinson’s) has a good specimen; the length of
    the fork, however, is greater than the united part. In the Prince of
    Wales Collection (Kensington) there is a two-bladed Sword, the fork
    only eight inches long, with the additional peculiarity of being
    saw-edged. In the other form, the Chelidonian proper, the fork is
    vertical, one prong being above the other. What use it could have
    supplied in cutting is hard to divine, but the Sword is essentially
    personal and eccentric. I know only one historical blade of this form,
    Zú’l-Fikár (Lord of Cleaving), the weapon given by the Archangel
    Gabriel to Mohammed, and by the latter to his son-in-law Ali bin Ali
    Tálib, who cleft with it the skull of Marhab, the giant Jew warrior of
    Khaybar Fort. It appears upon the arms of the Zeydi princes, lords of
    Sana’á in El-Yemen, Southern Arabia<a id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a>: nearer home it may be seen
    upon the Turkish standard, some twenty feet long, taken by Don John of
    Austria from the Turk at Lepanto.<a id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> The weapon probably owes this
    honour to having been mentioned amongst the Ahádís, or traditional
    sayings of the Apostle of El-Islam, ‘la Sayfa illa Zú’l-Fikár wa lá
    Fatá illa Ali’ (there is no Sword to be compared, for doing damage to
    the foe, with Zú’l-Fikár, and no valiant youth but Ali).</p>

  <div class="figright col20">
    <a id="f150"><img src="images/i_141_f150.jpg" width="107" height="100" alt="" /></a>
    <div class="caption smcap">Fig. 150.—Gold Coast.</div>
  </div>

  <p>Amongst the Chelidonian blades proper I do not include the double
    blade. A fair specimen of the latter is the Orissa Sword<a id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a>: two
    slightly oval forms spring from the same hilt, but separate throughout
    their length. Another shape is found upon the Gold Coast: the blades
    are disposed like the astronomical sign of Aries, and its only <span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>use is
    to slice off noses and ears.<a id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> The offending member is placed at the
    commissure, and an upward shear effects the mutilation. I reserve for a
    future page the ‘split Swords,’ two blades in one scabbard, which were
    used in mediæval Europe, and which have been preserved in China.</p>

  <p>To conclude this long and technical chapter. The Sword should be
    tightly mounted and well shouldered-up before and behind, leaving no
    interval between hilt and blade. The grip must be firm, and the tang
    secured either by rivets or, better still, by a screw at the pommel: if
    this be neglected, the weapon will not deliver a true edge. In trials
    both back and edge should be repeatedly struck with force upon a wooden
    post. Should the handle show no sign of loosening, and the blade ring
    with the right sound, it is a sign that the mounting is satisfactory:
    the reverse is the case if the blow jars or stings the hand: this
    suggests that the cut will not prove efficient.</p>

  <hr class="tb" />

  <p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—The type and model of the straight blade is the form
    of Rapier which we call the Toledo. It is probably derived from the
    Spatha or long Sword of the Roman cavalryman; but it assumed its
    present perfect shape during the reign of Charles Quint (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span>
    1493–1519). The exemplar of the curved blade is the so-called
    ‘Damascus’ sabre, dating probably from the early days of El-Islam
    (seventh century), when Eastern armies were chiefly composed of light
    Bedawi horsemen. Of these in Part II.</p>

  <p>The modern Egyptologist is reforming the false and one-sided theories
    based upon the meagre studies of anthropological literature in Greek,
    Latin, and Hebrew. Yet in the Nile Valley we are only upon the
    threshold of exploration—topographical, linguistic, and scientific. Of
    its proto-Egyptians and its primæval workmanship as yet we know little;
    and it is truly preposterous to suppose that man began his artistic
    life by building pyramids, cutting obelisks, and engraving hieroglyphs.
    The ‘Cushite School,’ based upon the Asiatic Ethiopians of Eusebius
    the Bishop,<a id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> and unfortunately represented by Bunsen, Maspero,
    Wilkinson, Mariette, Brugsch, and a host of minor names, has determined
    that the old Nilotes ‘undoubtedly came from Asia.’ The theory utterly
    lacks proof; and the same may be said of the popular assertion, based
    upon Biblical grounds—‘The early colonists of Egypt <span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>came thither
    from Mesopotamia.’ We seem to be reading fable when told (by William
    Osburn<a id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a>), ‘The skill of these primitive artists of Egypt was a
    portion of that civilisation which its first settlers brought with them
    when they located themselves in the Valley of the Nile.’</p>

  <p>My conviction is that the ancient Egyptians were Africans, and pure
    Africans; that the Nile-dwellers are still negroids whitened by a
    large infusion of Syrian, Arabian, and other Asiatic blood; and that
    Ethiopia is its old racial home. Æschylus had already robed their black
    limbs in white raiment when Herodotus (ii. 104) made them dark-skinned
    compared with the Arabs<a id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> and North Africans. Every traveller finds
    his description hold good to the present day. Blumenbach declared
    the old Egyptians to be of Berber origin, the race of Psametik, or
    the Son of the Sun. Hartmann opined that they were not Asiatics but
    Africans, and Dr. Morton modified his first opinion, finding the
    cranium to be negroid. I hope to prove their correctness by making a
    large collection of mummy skulls.<a id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> It is certain that the modern
    Egyptian’s hair—that great characteristic of race, according to Pruner
    Bey—is not silky, as Professor Huxley says, but wiry like that of
    his forefathers.<a id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> Moreover, his type, as distinctly shown by the
    Sphinx, is melanochroic-negroid. Lastly, there are other signs, which
    need not here be noticed, distinguishing the African—horse as well as
    human—from the Arabian.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>ANTIQUITY OF EGYPT.</i></div>

  <p>There is a history of ancient Egypt, into which we have not yet
    penetrated. Herodotus (ii. 142) glances at it when he makes the
    Ptah-priest at Memphis pretend to an antiquity of 11,340 years,<a id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a>
    during which reigned 341 generations of kings and pontiffs.<a id="FNanchor_457" href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a>
    Plato does the same when he speaks of hymns 10,000 years old, and
    Mela<a id="FNanchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> when he numbers 330 kings before Amasis, who ruled more than
    30,000 years. Mena (Menes), the first man-monarch who founded Memphis
    (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 4560?) some centuries before the Hebrew Creation, was
    preceded for 13,000 years by the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>‘Dynasty of the Gods’ (god-kings),
    suggesting a governmental hierarchy of the fetisheer caste: and this
    lasted for ages, till the Soldier upset the Priest and raised himself
    to the rank of Pharaoh<a id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> and king. Traces of the proto-Egyptian
    dynasties in which the men of the Pen controlled the men of the Sword
    long survived; and in later times the ecclesiastical order again ruled
    the military. We know nothing of the hierarchical supremacy but its
    baldest outline. When our modest chronologists allow 6000 years to its
    incept, they run into the contrary extreme of those who assign to it
    myriads of centuries. Rodier<a id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> is more reasonable; he opines that
    the cycle of 1,460 years dates in Egypt from <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 14,611.</p>

  <div class="figright col20">

    inches long).</div>
  </div>

  <p>Again, it will probably be found that ancient Egypt was <em>not</em> ‘the
    narrowest strip of land in the world running between a double desert.’
    The extent of ‘Kemi’<a id="FNanchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> has been arbitrarily confined to the Riverine
    Valley as far as the First Cataract, or seven hundred by seven miles
    widening out in the Delta-netherland to a base of eighty-one miles. We
    may fairly suspect that modern Masr is only a slice from the eastern
    half of the antique Mizraim. The Greeks made the frontier of Asia
    extend beyond the Suez isthmus and the Nile to the lands of Libya.<a id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a>
    This Greater Egypt is still suggested by the system of Bahr bilá má,
    large <i>Fiumare</i> now bone-dry, and by the alignment of the oases in
    the wilderness west of the River Valley with their giant ruins of
    a proto-historic Past. These may date from the days when the basin
    of the Bahr el-Ghazal—a lake like the Tanganyika and the Victoria
    Nyanza—discharged its annual flood to the North in channels parallel
    with the ‘River Ægyptus.’<a id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> The lacustrine bed would silt up by the
    natural process of warping, and the surplus water, no longer able to
    discharge northwards, would force itself eastwards to the Nile. The
    easier drainage would presently convert the lake into a river-basin and
    system, and the lands no longer irrigated would become a waste dotted
    like a leopard skin with oases or watered valleys.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span></p>

  <p>An abundance of popular literature has familiarised the public
    with the outer aspect of ancient Egypt, but the world is still far
    from recognising the message she sent to mankind. We must go back
    to ‘the Wonderland on the banks of the mighty Nile’ for the origin
    of all things which most interest us. It is the very cradle-land
    of language. Her tongue contains all the elements of the so-called
    ‘Aryan,’<a id="FNanchor_464" href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> Semitic, and Allophyllian or Turanian families, and dates
    long before the days of the present distribution. Bunsen’s ‘Egypt’
    first noticed this fact at some length, without, however, dwelling
    upon its importance. ‘All Semitic pronouns and suffixes,’ says M.
    C. Bertin, ‘can be traced back to Egyptian, especially the Egyptian
    of the earliest dynasties’; he might have added much about other
    mechanical forms. Brugsch tells us (i. 3) that the primitive roots and
    the essential elements of the Egyptian grammar point to an intimate
    connection of the Indo-Germanic (!) and Semitic languages.<a id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> The
    Allophyllian or Agglutinative Turanian,<a id="FNanchor_466" href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> a <i>tertium quid</i> which is
    neither ‘Aryan’ nor ‘Semitic,’ is also traceable in old Coptic.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>ORIGINS IN EGYPT.</i></div>

  <p>What, then, do these facts suggest? Simply that the elements existing
    in Egyptian travelled from the banks of the Nile and evolved,
    discreted, and differentiated themselves in many centres. The
    word-compounding or Iranian scheme found homes in Eastern Europe
    (Greece, Italy, and the Slavonic or quasi-Asiatic half); in Asia
    Minor—especially Phrygia—in Mesopotamia, in Persia, and finally in
    India, where the settlement was comparatively modern. This explains
    how a philologist would derive Sanskrit from Lithuania. This saves
    us from the ‘Aryan heresy’;<a id="FNanchor_467" href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> this abolishes ‘Indo-European,’ and
    worse still ‘Indo-Germanic’—that model specimen of national modesty.
    Both are terms which contain a theory and an unproved theory. Again,
    the word-developing or Arabian scheme, absurdly termed Semitic (from
    Shem!), increased, multiplied, and perfected itself in Northern Africa
    and Arabia, while the Turanian, becoming independent and specialised in
    Akkadian, overspread Tartary and China.</p>

  <p>And this one primæval language of Egypt framed for itself an alphabet
    whence <span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>are derived all others. This is proved by the fact that each
    and all begin, as Plutarch tells us old Coptic did, with the letter
    A. Of its age in Nile-land we may judge from the cartouche containing
    Khufu’s name, left by some workman on an inner block of the Great
    Pyramid.<a id="FNanchor_468" href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> How many generations of articulate-speaking men must have
    come and gone before so artificial and artistic a system as the Royal
    Signature upon the Shield occurred to the human mind!</p>

  <p>But Egypt did still more. She was the fountain-head of knowledge
    which overflowed the world. Eastward the great current set through
    Babylonia and Chaldæa, Persia and India, Indo-China, China, and Japan,
    to Australia and Polynesia. Westward it flooded Africa and Europe. It
    may have reached America by two ways. The Oriental line would extend
    from China and Japan to the Eastern Pacific coast: the Occidental was
    practicable <i>viâ</i> Atlantis, or possibly in the days when Behring’s
    Straits did not exist. It found a new Mediterranean in the great
    Caribbean Gulf, and new Indies in Mexico and Peru. Indeed, the march of
    intellect from Egypt is conterminous with the limits of the habitable
    globe.</p>

  <p>The invention of an alphabet would necessarily lead to
    literature—poetry, history, and criticism. The earliest known
    manuscript is the Prisse (d’Avennes) Papyrus, a roll dating from
    the days of Pharaoh Tat-ka-ra, last of the Fifth Dynasty (circ.
    <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 3000). It is a collection of proverbs, maxims, precepts,
    and commandments, of which the fifth is, ‘Honour thy father and thy
    mother, that thy life may be long’: the style is admirable for its
    humorous vein, and for its graphic description of old age—‘Senex
    bis puer.’ The earliest epic is the heroic poem of Pentaur, laureate
    to Ramses II. (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 1333–1300); it is the prototype of the
    cyclic songs which, in Cyprus especially, preceded the <i lang="fr">chef-d’œuvre</i>
    of the Homerid chief; and it opens with an ‘Arma Virumque cano.’ The
    ‘Deadbook’ is the birth of the Drama, and it may date ages before the
    dialogues of Job. The ‘Canticles of Solomon’ are in the evocations of
    Isis and Nephthys.<a id="FNanchor_469" href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> The <i>critique</i> of a young author’s production
    by a purist in style might add a sting to reviewing in the present
    day.<a id="FNanchor_470" href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> To the Egyptians we must attribute the invention of maps and
    plans. They first studied heraldry: every nome had its distinctive
    emblem, generally bird or beast; and each temple and guild its
    blazon.<a id="FNanchor_471" href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a></p>

  <p>Literature would be imperfect without art and science, and accordingly
    we find their head-quarters and old home in Egypt. These studies
    humanised the people; their code suggests the mildness of modern penal
    law; and their reverence for letters, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>for old age, and for the dignity
    of man, makes them an eternal example to the world. The monuments show
    their fondness for music and painting. Their knowledge of statuary
    is proved by a host of works, especially the wooden Shaykh el-Balad
    (village chief) in the Bulak Museum—a marvel of skill, probably dating
    from the Fourth Dynasty, <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 3700. In architecture they
    invented the arch, round and pointed; eight several orders of columns,
    including the proto-Doric; Atlantes, Caryatides, and human-shaped
    consoles. The ‘temple of Jízeh’ near the sphinx is evidently older than
    the adjoining pyramids; it is a model of solidity in which the hardest
    stone is worked like wood.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>EGYPT THE CRADLE-LAND.</i></div>

  <p>In science they especially cultivated geometry, astronomy, astrology,
    and ‘alchemy,’ whose name betrays its origin. Their arithmetic taught
    decimals and duodecimals. Their mathematics arose from measuring fields
    and calculating the cubes of altars. They knew the precession of the
    equinoxes: Rodier (p. 31) considers that they learnt it from observing
    the equinoctial point and the rising of Sothis, the Tuth-star, ‘the
    axle of the skies,’ in the same zodiacal sign, and that the studies
    at Syene date from <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 17,932. They knew the motion of the
    apsides, and the solar and stellar periods; they invented latitude and
    longitude; they denoted by a cross the intersection of the solstices
    and the equinoxes, and they published annual calendars. In optics
    they invented the lens. They were not ignorant of the motive power of
    steam, and possibly the electric fish had taught them the rudiments of
    electricity.</p>

  <p>They were great in the mechanical arts. In medicine they dissected
    and vivisected: in agriculture they invented the plough, the harrow,
    the toothed sickle, the flail, and the tribulum; in carpentry the
    dove-tail; in ceramics the potter’s wheel, and in hydraulics the
    water-wheel. In gardening they transplanted full-grown trees. They
    made glass, porcelain, and counterfeit pearls and precious stones;
    and they used emery powder and the lapidary’s wheel. They spun silk,
    and knew the use of mordants for stuffs and dyes for hair. They made
    ‘babies’ (dolls) and children’s toys of clay, and they moulded masks of
    papier-mâché. In some points they were strangely modern. For hunting
    they wore dresses of ‘suppressed colour,’ not pink nor ‘rifleman’s
    green’: we are just beginning to find out our mistakes. They affected
    falconry, and played at the draughts which led to chess; and at
    <i>morra</i>, the Roman <i>micare digitis</i>. They sat on chairs whose shapes
    are like ours, not on divans nor on triclinia. In their house furniture
    they studiously avoided over-regularity; and Japan is now teaching
    England and Germany not to weary man’s eye by monotony.</p>

  <p>And as they were advanced in literature and politics, the religion
    of earth, so they assiduously cultivated religion, the politics of
    heaven. The Biblical student has found among the tombs of Nile-land the
    absolute truth of what Celsus said—namely, that the Hebrews borrowed
    their tenets and practices from Egypt. Their date of the creation
    <i>ex nihilo</i> (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 4004–4620) was evidently Manetho’s period
    of the succession of Mena, and it is used even in our day. Their
    genesitic cosmogony,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span> as Philo Judæus shows, and as Origen expressly
    declares, was an adaptation of Nilotic allegories and mysteries which
    the vulgar understood factually and literally. Their ‘Adam’ suggests
    ‘Atum,’ whence ‘Adima,’ the First Man amongst the Hindus. Their App or
    Apap (Apophis), whose determinative is a snake transfixed with four
    knife-blades,<a id="FNanchor_472" href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> is the great old serpent, the ophid-giant, Sin,
    Sathanas. The ‘Flood’<a id="FNanchor_473" href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> is the annual Nilotic inundation modified
    by the Izdubar legends of the Interamnian Plain. Noah, Nuh, Nöe, is
    suspiciously like Nu or Nuhu,<a id="FNanchor_474" href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> the Sailor of the Waters, the Lord
    of the Full Nile. Ham suggests Kam, the black race. The ark is the
    Bahr or Ua (Baris, Argo navis) of Nu, the sacred vessel portrayed in
    the ruins of Egyptian Elephanta, the boat of Osiris, or Uasur, the
    man-formed Sun-god; and the floating cradle of Moses is a mere replica
    of Osiris’ ark. In that complicated idolatry of deceased ancestors,
    based upon a system of monotheism,<a id="FNanchor_475" href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a> or rather the worship of
    glorified man, which formed the religion of Egypt, the Sun typified
    human life. He rose as the infant Horus; he was the Lord Ka of the
    mid-day; as Tum he became old and set; and as Hormakhu (Harmachis) he
    shone to the under world below the horizon, Night and Death being the
    forerunners of Light and Life.<a id="FNanchor_476" href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a></p>

  <p>The preternatural apparatus of both faiths (original and borrowed) is
    the same. The four genii of Death—Amset (under Isis), Hapi (Nephthys),
    Tuamutef (Neith), and Khebsenauf (Sebk)—became the four archangels. Of
    Urim and Thummim, the latter is the plural of Thmei (Themis), the blind
    or headless goddess of Truth and Justice.<a id="FNanchor_477" href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a> Even such phrases as ‘I
    am that I am’<a id="FNanchor_478" href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> are loans from the hierogrammat; Ankh (I am Life)
    was rendered Yahveh (Jehovah). This ‘ineffable name’<a id="FNanchor_479" href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> is borrowed
    by some, Colenso included, from Semitic heathenism; but Brugsch shows
    that Egypt supplied the Mosaic conception of the Creator. There
    appears, indeed, direct derivation in the unity of the Deity and in the
    duality of Typhon, Set, Satan, the Evil Spirit. Later ages copied the
    local Triads of Kemi, in which the third proceeded from the other two.
    Both ecclesiastical establishments contained <span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>Prophets (<i>Sem</i>),<a id="FNanchor_480" href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a>
    High Priests,<a id="FNanchor_481" href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a> Priests, ‘Holy Fathers,’ and Scribes. The Decalogue
    is a <i>résumé</i> of the forty-two commandments in the Deadbook (chapter
    125). The portable shrines of the great Egyptian gods originated the
    Tabernacle, which grew to be the Temple; it corresponds with the <span lang="grc">Σχήνη
    ἱερὰ</span> or movable tent of the Carthaginians. The African practice of
    circumcision was probably intended originally as a prophylactic against
    syphilis, of which traces have been found in prehistoric bones. The
    peculiar Jewish hatred for pork is reasonless unless we explain it by a
    superstitious horror of the Typhonian beast. Rationalists tell us that
    the meat was religiously forbidden because unwholesome in the tropics,
    a <i lang="la">causa non causa</i>: it is the favourite food in the Brazil, in China,
    and in Christian India; even the Maráthás will eat wild hog; nor are
    the habits of the animal more filthy than the duck’s. The truth is that
    these dietary prohibitions served to make a <i>differentia</i>, to disunite
    man, to pit race against race and to feed the priest.</p>

  <p>But while the Hebrews drew largely upon the wisdom (and the unwisdom)
    of Egypt, they ruthlessly cast out the eminently Nilotic ideas of a
    Soul, of a Judgment of the Dead, and of a future state of rewards
    and punishments—three tenets which, in modern days, form the very
    foundation of all faiths. ‘If a man die, shall he live (again)?’
    asks Job (xiv. 14), in a chapter showing that life once lost is lost
    for ever.<a id="FNanchor_482" href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a> And apparently from the days of Moses this was the
    peculiarity of ‘Semitic’ thought; it lived in the Present and had
    no Future, or rather it spurned the world to come. ‘Moses,’ says
    Professor Owen, ‘could not admit the after-life, or teach of reward and
    retribution in a future state, without risk of tainting his monotheism
    with some trace of the manifold symbolism environing the “divine
    son of Amen” (Osiris), who after suffering loss of the mortal life,
    which he had assumed for bettering his kind, became, on resigning his
    divinity, their judge.’ The Hebrews adopted Soul and Judgment, Heaven
    and Hell, many centuries after Moses from their Assyrian kinsmen,<a id="FNanchor_483" href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a>
    who also supplied them with their present names for the twelve months
    and sundry astronomical notions. And their modern descendants by
    universally accepting a Resurrection have done that against which Moses
    so carefully guarded.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span></p>

  <p>I need hardly say that the mythologies of Greece, Etruria, and Rome
    only corrupted Egyptian mysteries and metaphysics. Three instances will
    suffice: Charon is a degraded Horus; Minos is Mena, and Rhadamanthus
    contains the word Amenti, the right side (of Osiris), the west.
    Nor can we be surprised if Egypt is now giving rise to scientific
    superstitions. Every reader of ‘Pyramid Literature’ will note the
    mysterious influence which Kemi is exercising upon the modern mind.<a id="FNanchor_484" href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a></p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>EGYPTIAN METALLURGY.</i></div>

  <p>In the preceding chapters I have noted the development of metallurgy
    by the ancient Egyptians. They probably began with gold,<a id="FNanchor_485" href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> the
    easiest of all ores to find and to work; it was abundant in Upper
    Egypt, and about <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 1600 they found a California in ‘Kush’
    (Æthiopia). They called it Tum, Khetem, and Nb, which is variously
    pronounced Nebu, Neb, and Nub, whence Nubia. It has two hieroglyphic
    determinatives
    <img class="iglyph-2" src="images/i_151_s.png" alt="" width="63" height="15" />,
    the necklace and the washing-bowl
    covered with the straining-cloth. The Kemites called silver ‘white
    gold,’<a id="FNanchor_486" href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a> showing the movement of invention; and they could draw
    silver wire three thousand years ago. Wilkinson (II. chap. viii.)
    remarks, ‘The position of the silver-mines is unknown’; but he wrote
    before the discovery of Midian, where surface-stones have been picked
    up containing three ounces per ton. As their pictures prove, they
    worked iron, although little has outlasted the corrosion of Time. They
    applied the blow-pipe to the works of the whitesmith. They were well
    acquainted with soldering by lead or alloys,<a id="FNanchor_487" href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> as is shown by the
    Shesh or Sistrum of Mr. Burton. I may here remark parenthetically that
    this <i>crepitaculum</i> used in temple-service gave rise to the Maracá or
    Tammaraka, the sacred rattle, a gourd full of pebbles worshipped by
    the Brazilian Tupis, who thus acknowledged the mysterious influence
    of rhythmic sounds.<a id="FNanchor_488" href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a> They were skilful in the damascening<a id="FNanchor_489" href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> or
    inlaying of weapons, an invention claimed <span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>by those model ‘claimants,’
    the Greeks. Their simple process was to cut out the ground, to hammer
    in gold and silver, and, finally, to file and polish the surface.<a id="FNanchor_490" href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a></p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>EGYPTIAN WEAPONS.</i></div>

  <p>The metallurgic proficiency of Old Egypt would lead to the development
    of arms and armour, and enable the soldier to win easier victories
    over the ‘vile, impure, and miserable Gentiles’—i.e. all men except
    themselves. The god Anhar, or Shu, is ‘Lord of the Scymitar.’ Horus,
    as a hawk-headed mummied deity, is seated holding two Swords. Amen-Ra,
    Lord of Hab, is a ‘great god Ramenma, “Lord of the Sword.”’ The
    ‘wearer of the Pshent or double crown’ (the Pharaoh), the image of
    Monthu, god of war, was <i>ex-officio</i> ‘His Holiness’ (high-priest) and
    Commander-in-Chief, who personally led his warriors to ‘wash their
    hearts’ (cool their valours) as the Zulus wash their spears. Like
    Horus, he is ‘valiant with the Sword.’<a id="FNanchor_491" href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> When going to war he was
    presented with the ‘Falchion of Victory,’ and thus addressed: ‘Take
    this weapon, and smite with it the heads of the unclean.’ In paintings
    and sculptures he is a large and heroic figure: he draws the bow, he
    spears or cuts down the foe, and he drives his war-car over the bodies
    of the slain. His soldiers are divided into Calasiri (Krashr<a id="FNanchor_492" href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> or
    bowmen) and Hermotybians, the latter unsatisfactorily derived<a id="FNanchor_493" href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a> from
    <span lang="grc">ἡμιτύβιον</span>, a strong linen (waist-?) cloth. The two divisions represent
    the second of the five castes, ranking below the priestly and above
    the agricultural: they held one of the three portions into which the
    land was divided. Recruits were taught in the military schools that
    originated the Pentathlon and the Pancratium, the Palæstra and the
    Gymnasium. They were carefully trained to gymnastics, as the monumental
    pictures in the Beni Hasan tombs show; they used Mogdars or Indian
    clubs, and they excelled in wrestling, though not in boxing. The royal
    statues are those of athletes, with their broad shoulders, thin flanks
    and well-developed muscles. The soldier practised single-stick, the
    right hand being apparently protected by a basket-guard, and the left
    forearm shielded by a splint or splints of wood, strapped on, and
    serving for a shield (fig. 152).</p>

  <p>The standing army consisted of foot and horse,<a id="FNanchor_494" href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> the latter being
    mostly in chariots; and they were divided into corps, regiments,
    battalions, and companies. The men were officered by Chiliarchs
    (colonels), Hekatontarchs (captains), and Dekarchs (sergeants), as
    the Greeks called them. The ‘heavies’ were armed with a long strong
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
    spear and an immense shield provided with a sight-hole. Some carried
    the ‘Lisán’-club, the battle-axe, and the mace; and almost all had for
    side arms pole-axes,<a id="FNanchor_495" href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a> Swords, falchions, and daggers. The ‘light
    bobs’ were chiefly archers and slingers, also weaponed with ‘Lisáns,’
    axes, war-flails, and Swords. The chariot-corps or cavalry, besides
    bows and arrows, had clubs and short Swords for close quarters. The
    battle-axes show clear derivation from the stone celt, which supplied
    the hieroglyphs with the word Natr or Netr (Neter, &amp;c.), meaning god,
    gods, or goddess
    <span class="large">(</span><img class="iglyph-4" src="images/i_154_s.png" alt="" width="8" height="20" /><span class="large">)</span>.<a id="FNanchor_496" href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a>
    In the Demotic alphabet the
    axe was K (<i>Kelebia</i>).</p>

  <p>The action began, at the sound of the trumpet, with an advance of
    light-infantry, bowmen, slingers, and javelineers. Then came the charge
    by the ponderous phalanx of ten thousand men, one hundred in front by
    one hundred deep, and flanked by chariots and cavalry. Thus the close
    combat was not the disorderly system of duels that prevailed in the
    barbarous Middle Ages of Europe. In storming fortified places they used
    the pavoise and testudo, the ram, the scaling-ladder, the bulwark or
    movable tower, and the portable bridge. They were also skilful military
    miners.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span></p>
  <div class="sidenote"><i>THE EGYPTIAN SWORD.</i></div>

  <p>The Egyptian phalanx was armed with the large shield, lance, and
    Sword; the latter was generally called Seft,
    <img class="iglyph-4" src="images/i_155_s01.png" alt="" width="20" height="25" />, or
    <img class="iglyph-4" src="images/i_155_s02.png" alt="" width="57" height="25" />, or
    <img class="iglyph-4" src="images/i_155_s03.png" alt="" width="36" height="25" />; also inverted to Setf,
    <img class="iglyph-4" src="images/i_155_s04.png" alt="" width="41" height="25" />:
    it becomes Sifet in Æthiopia, and in Berber Siwuit.
    The weapon in the hieroglyphs is of four different shapes. The first
    is the boomerang-Sword
    <img class="iglyph-4" src="images/i_155_s05.png" alt="" width="10" height="25" />, <i>m</i> or <i>ma</i>, meaning ‘to
    destroy’: this M is the root of the Hebrew and Arabic <i>Maut</i> and the
    Prakrit-Sanskrit, <i>Mar</i>. The second is the Knife-Sword
    <img class="iglyph-4" src="images/i_155_s06.png" alt="" width="11" height="25" />,
    <i>At</i> or <i>Kat</i>, the determinative of cutting. These two are joined
    <img class="iglyph-4" src="images/i_155_s07.png" alt="" width="18" height="25" />
    in the root <i>ma</i> (cut, mow). The third is the Khopsh,
    Khepsh, or Khepshi,
    <img class="iglyph-4" src="images/i_155_s08.png" alt="" width="40" height="15" />,
    the sickle-Sword, still used in
    Abyssinia and throughout Africa: with a flattened curve it became the
    Hindu Kubja, the Greek ‘Kopis,’ and the Gurkha ‘Kukkri.’ The second two
    are combined in the root Smam,
    <img class="iglyph-4" src="images/i_155_s09.png" alt="" width="41" height="25" />, ‘to smite.’ Other
    names of the Sword are Ta or Nai,
    <img class="iglyph-4" src="images/i_155_s10.png" alt="" width="27" height="20" />, and Nai, Na’ui, or
    Nakhtui, <img class="iglyph-4" src="images/i_155_s11.png" alt="" width="67" height="25" />.</p>

  <p>The falchion (<i>ensis falcatus</i>), called Shopsh, Khepsh, or Khopsh,<a id="FNanchor_497" href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a>
    is represented as early as the Sixth Dynasty (after <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
    3000). Hence, says Meyrick, the <span lang="grc">Κοπὶς</span> of Argos—Argolis being a very
    mixed province, where the base was Pelasgian and the superstructure
    was Egyptian; the latter introduced by Danaus, and followed by the
    Phœnicians, who founded the town Phœnicia. Quintus Curtius (lib. iii.)
    says: ‘Copides vocant gladios leviter curvatos, falcibus similes,
    quibus appetebant belluarum manus.’ Apuleius (‘Met.’ lib. xi.) also
    speaks of ‘copides et venabula.’<a id="FNanchor_498" href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span></p>

  <p>Evidently the Egyptian Sf, Sefi, Seft, or ‘Sword’ generically,<a id="FNanchor_499" href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a>
    gave rise to the Mesopotamian Sibir, Sibirru, and Sapara; to the Greek
    <span lang="grc">ξίφ-ος</span>; to the Aramæan Saiph, Sipho, and to the Arabic <span lang="ar">صيف</span> (Sayf-un),
    the second syllables being merely terminative; while the Latin <i>spatha</i>
    and the German Schwerte, and our Swerde and Sword, are the latest
    echoes of Sef and Seft. The Germans say rightly, ‘Nichts wandert so
    leicht als Waffen und Waffennamen.’</p>

  <p>Another Egyptian name for the sickle-shaped blade is Khrobi,<a id="FNanchor_500" href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> which
    suggests the Hebrew Hereb (a weapon, a Sword). We are also sure that
    the words are primitive Egyptian: the proof is that the symbol of ‘Má’
    (‘destroy’ &amp;c.), the Khopsh or <i>ensis falcatus</i>, is the numeral nine;
    and the straight flesh-blade (<i>Kt</i>) is the pronoun thou, thee: the two
    together alluded to the oldest religious practice.<a id="FNanchor_501" href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a></p>

  <p>The falchion, shaped in the pattern of Ursæ major (?), was thick-backed
    and weighted with bronze; the blade, in later days at least,<a id="FNanchor_502" href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a>
    was of iron or steel, as shown by the blue colour. Champollion<a id="FNanchor_503" href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a>
    notices blue Swords with golden hilts in <span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>the tomb of Ramses III., and
    a ‘weapon Kops’ with the gold, of which the hilt consists, running up
    the concave back of the blade. ‘The gold was therefore either sunk into
    the iron, or gilded on the back. In other cases the Kops of kings was
    entirely of gold, or, like other Swords, entirely of brass (copper?).
    In another similar weapon, brass (copper?) and iron were blended in the
    blade.’ An iron ‘Kops’ was found in a tomb at Gurnah.</p>

  <p>The Khopsh, a sickle in type, and originally a throwing weapon as
    well as a cutting arm, was always carried by the Pharaoh, who used it
    indifferently with the pike (<i>Taru</i>), the mace, axe (<i>Aka</i>, <i>Akhu</i>),
    battle-axe, or pole-axe (<i>Kheten</i>). Officers and privates, ‘lights’
    as well as ‘heavies,’ also wielded it in pictures. Those commanding
    infantry-corps are armed with the simple stick like the Roman centurion
    and our drill-sergeant of bygone days.</p>

  <p>The fourth or long-straight Sword, which does not appear in the
    hieroglyphs, had a two-edged cut-and-thrust leaf-shaped blade from two
    and a half to three feet long,<a id="FNanchor_504" href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a> with a foining point like that
    of the Somal.<a id="FNanchor_505" href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a> These large weapons seem to have <span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>been used by
    foreign mercenaries. The leaf- also becomes a trowel-form, betraying
    its origin and derivation, the spear-head. The grip was hollowed away
    in the centre, gradually thickening at either end, and was sometimes
    inlaid with metal, stones, and precious woods. The pommel of that worn
    in the Pharaoh’s girdle is surmounted by one or more hawk-heads, this
    bird being the symbol of Ra<a id="FNanchor_506" href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a> (the Sun). The handle is also adorned
    with small pins and studs of gold, shown through suitable openings in
    the front part of the sheath. With this weapon the warrior stabs the
    enemy in the throat, as Mithras strikes the bull behind the shoulder.
    A modified form was the Sword-dagger, of which two are sometimes
    represented with the Pharaoh: it was generally carried in the belt.
    This shape of weapon found its way to the Caucasus;<a id="FNanchor_507" href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> and the
    Georgian Khanjar, hanging to the girdle in the place of the Sword, is
    also a survival.</p>

  <p>The Egyptian weapon is of various lengths. The bronze blade of Amunoph
    II., found by Wilkinson at Thebes, measures only five and a quarter
    inches: others rise to seven and even ten. Mr. Salt’s specimen in the
    British Museum covers eleven and a half inches, including the handle;
    and others reach one foot, and even sixteen inches. Many of these
    blades taper from an inch and a half to two-thirds <span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>of an inch near
    the point. Dr. John Evans<a id="FNanchor_508" href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> has a Sword, found at ‘Great Kantara’
    during the construction of the Suez Canal; the blade is leaf-shaped,
    and measures seventeen inches, and the whole length twenty-two inches
    and three-eighths (fig. 165). ‘Instead of a hilt-plate, it is drawn
    down to a small tang about three-sixteenths of an inch square. This
    again expands into an octagonal bar about three-eighths of an inch in
    diameter, which has been drawn down to a point, and then turned back
    to form a hook, perhaps the earliest mode of hanging to the belt.’ At
    the base of the blade are two rivet-holes, and the hilt must have been
    formed of two pieces which clasped the tang. Dr. Evans also mentions a
    bronze Sword-blade, presumably from Lower Egypt, in the Berlin Museum:
    it has an engraved line down each side of the blade; it is more uniform
    in width than the Kantara specimen, and the hilt is broken off.</p>

  <p>Not a few Egyptian Swords are much thicker at the middle than at the
    edges, and many are slightly grooved. The bronze is so well tempered,
    either by hammering, by hydraulic pressure, or by phosphorisation (?),
    that it has retained spring and pliability after several thousand
    years, and is still elastic like the steel of our modern days. I have
    already noticed<a id="FNanchor_509" href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> the Passalacqua and the Harris daggers—both from
    Thebes. The dagger-handle was generally covered in part with metal like
    that of the Sword; and the sewing of the leather-sheath again recalls
    the hide-scabbard of the Somal.<a id="FNanchor_510" href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a> The Egyptians, as the hieroglyphs
    prove, had also single-edged <span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>cutting-knives shorter than Swords, and
    apparently of steel; they resemble our flesh-knives,<a id="FNanchor_511" href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> and may
    correspond with the Greek <span lang="grc">μάχαιραι</span> (Ang.-Sax. <i>Meche</i>), while the
    daggers proper represent the <span lang="grc">ἐγχειρίδια</span> and the parazonia.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>EGYPTIAN SWORDS.</i></div>

  <p>The long Sword must have been rare or rather barbaric, for it is seldom
    found in the pictures and bas-reliefs. Yet Rosellini figures one which
    resembles an Espadon or heavy two-handed weapon of our Middle Ages. An
    inscription of Ramses takes as booty from the Maxyes (Cyrenians) of
    Libya one hundred and fifteen Swords of five cubits (seven and a half
    feet), and one hundred and twenty-four of three cubits long.</p>

  <p>Meyrick,<a id="FNanchor_512" href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a> in his general introduction to the weapons of all
    nations (vol. i. Pl. 1), gives two forms of Egyptian blades, or rather
    choppers. One (<i>a</i>, fig. 174) is a straight bill-shaped cutting-blade
    with the tip upturned, and the handle is provided with cords and
    tassels. This is in fact the old Turkish Scymitar and its offshoots, of
    which I have already spoken; and thus Egypt led to the chopper-types,
    which will presently be noticed. The other (<i>b</i>) is a curved Scymitar,
    with a bevelled end and a double cord at the hilt.<a id="FNanchor_513" href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> The former
    seems to be an imitation of the obsidian flake: the latter is a
    development of the Khopsh or sickle-Sword.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span></p>
  <div class="sidenote">THE SWORD IN AFRICA.</div>

  <p>And here I must temporarily abandon the chronological for the
    geographical order, and briefly treat of the Sword in modern Africa.</p>

  <p>In the Dark Continent, as in the New World, the weapon has scant
    importance. Reviewing the arms of the former ‘Quarter,’ we must
    conclude that its favourites are the war-axe (employed in rough work),
    and the spear<a id="FNanchor_514" href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> (used in fine work); while the Sword proper is
    confined, as a rule, to Moslem Africa.</p>

  <p>We have seen that in olden time the Mashaua (Maxyes) of Libya,
    bordering upon Egypt, used large Swords. The Adyrmachidæ, or ‘first
    Libyans’ of Herodotus (iv. 168), called by Silius Italicus (iii. 219)
    ‘gens accola Nili,’ were also armed with curved blades.</p>

  <p>Denham and Clapperton inform us that the Knights of Malta exported
    great numbers of the straight double-edged blades which they affected,
    to Benghazi, in North Africa, where they were exchanged for bullocks.
    From the Tripolitan they were borne across the Sahará to Bornu, to
    Hausaland, and to Kano, where they were remounted for the use of the
    negroid Moslem population. Modern travellers note that the trade still
    continues at Kano, where some fifty thousand blades were annually
    imported across the Mediterranean—the reason is that these negroids
    cannot make their own. Hence they are passed on to the Pule (Fulah)
    and Fulbe tribes, the Hausas, the Bornuese, and others dwelling in the
    north-western interior. The great Mandenga family, miscalled Mandingos,
    are also purchasers of European blades, which they mount and sheathe
    for themselves. Far to the south-east Mr. Henry M. Stanley (<i>loc. cit.</i>
    i. 454) notes that the ‘King of Kishakka possesses an Arab scimitar,
    which is a venerated heirloom of the royal family, and the sword of the
    founder of that kingdom’ (?).</p>

  <p>Barth (‘Travels’) has left us accurate though scanty details concerning
    the weapons of the North-Western and West-Central Africa. ‘Spears and
    Swords’ (say the people) ‘are the only manly and becoming weapons.’
    The blade, mostly made at Solingen,<a id="FNanchor_515" href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a> characterises the free and
    noble Amoshágh or Imoshágh; and all travellers remark that it preserves
    the old knightly form of crusading days; the low-caste Tawárik carry
    only the lance and the regular African Telak or arm-knife. The Forawy
    trust almost wholly to their Swords: the Kel-Owy (Khayl, or people, of
    the Owi Valley) and the Kel-Geres carry spear, Sword, and dagger. The
    Imgád, a degraded tribe of the negroid Berbers, are not allowed to use
    either Sword or spear: similarly the bow is confined to the servile
    caste among the Somal. The son of the Kazi, near Agades, was armed with
    an iron spear, Sword, and dagger (vol. i. 395): a Musghu chief had a
    boomerang-Sword (Front. vol. iii.). Few of the Baghirmi can afford
    ‘Kaskara’ (Swords), and they rarely wear the Kinyá or arm-knife: the
    favourite weapon of these races, as well as the Kamuri or Bornavis,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>is the Njiga or Golîyo, which has been noticed under the name of
    Danisko.<a id="FNanchor_516" href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> It is a short and double-pointed Egyptian hand-bill,
    thrown, as well as used for cutting. At Sokoto the traveller found good
    iron (iv. 180): at Kano, in Hausaland, he observed a blacksmith making,
    with the rudest tools, a leaf-shaped dagger, a long-ribbed, highly
    decorated, and very sharp blade. The Tawárik call the smith ‘Enhad’; in
    Timbukhtu he becomes the Mu’allim or artist.</p>

  <p>The Sword-play of North Africa is that of Arabia and India,
    apparently borrowed from the original Sword-dance.<a id="FNanchor_517" href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> In Tangier
    it is picturesquely described by a lively Italian writer, Edmondo de
    Amicis.<a id="FNanchor_518" href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> ‘There were three swordsmen, and they used the stick
    in pairs. It is impossible to do justice to the extravagance and
    buffoonery (<i>goffagini</i>) of that <em>school</em>: I call it so because we
    saw the same style in the other cities of Marocco. There were all the
    movements of the rope-dance, high leaps without object, contusions,
    leg-actions, and blows, announced a whole minute before by an immense
    sweep of the arm. Everything was done with a holy phlegm which would
    have allowed one of our experts to have distributed, amongst all four,
    a volley of blows without the least risk of receiving one.’</p>

  <p>The old Egyptian Sword-types spread deep into the Dark Continent, and
    preserve their forms to the present day. The Somal’s weapon shows the
    straight or spear-blade. The Shotel or Abyssinian Sword (fig. 176) is
    a direct descendant from the Khopsh-falchion. Nothing less handy than
    this gigantic sickle; the edge is inside, the grip is too small, and
    the difficulty of drawing the blade from the scabbard is considerable.
    The handle, four inches long, is a rude lump of black wood, and the
    tang is carried to the pommel and there clinched. The coarse and ugly
    blade has a mid-rib running the whole length, forming a double slope
    to the edges; it is one inch broad at the base, and tapers to a point
    which can hardly be used. The length along the arc is three feet
    thirty-seven inches; the curve, measuring from arc to chord, is two
    inches; and the projection beyond the directing line is four inches.
    The rough scabbard of untanned hide is shod with a hollow brass knob,
    a ferule ruder even than the blade; and a large iron buckle affixed
    to the top of the scabbard under the haft, connects with a belt or
    waist-strap. Such a weapon never belonged to a race of Swordsmen.<a id="FNanchor_519" href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a></p>

  <p>The Africo-Arab tribes of the Upper Nile (e.g. the Bisharín) also
    preserve Egyptian forms derived from the Lisán-stick. The Galla Sword
    is shorter and simpler than the Egyptian. But the Flissa of Northern
    Africa, the Yataghan whose type, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>by the support of the Duc d’Aumale,
    supplied France for years with a bad bayonet, if borrowed from the
    Lisán, has assumed a peculiar curve. Colonel A. Lane-Fox looks upon
    this Flissa of the Kabyles (= Kabáil, the tribes) as resembling the
    ‘Kopis-blade straightened, like those represented in the hands of the
    Greek warrior on the vase in the Museum at Naples.’<a id="FNanchor_520" href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a> Nothing can be
    better adapted for close fight than the handy stabbing weapon: stuck
    on the end of a musket, and making the barrel top-heavy, nothing can
    be worse. But, as the ‘military tailor’ in the British army seeks the
    philosopher’s stone in the shape of a suit of uniform that shall be
    at once warm and cool, heavy and light, airy and impermeable to wet,
    handsome and lasting, cheap and good, so the Frenchman would transform
    the bayonet into a <i lang="la">multum in parvo</i>, a Sword, a saw, <i lang="fr">a coupe-choux</i>,
    in fact everything that a bayonet is not and ought not to be. The
    absurd Yataghan-bayonet has only lately been banished from the French
    army, and retains its place in most Continental forces.</p>

  <p>The Sword amongst the Dankali tribes, who occupy the south-western
    shores of the Red Sea, north of the Somal, is evidently of European
    origin. The straight, thin blade, with two or more longitudinal
    grooves, is about four feet long, and broadens towards the point:
    the handle consists of a pommel, of a grip whipped with wire, and of
    straight quillons, forming a regular cross-guard. The modern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span> weapons
    are made in Germany—I believe, at Solingen, which seems to supply all
    Africa north of the Equator.</p>

  <p>Our age has at length realised the fact that the heart of Africa is
    inhabited by a homogeneous race speaking tongues of the same family.
    It is a large and strong-bodied people, often cannibal, and showing no
    likeness with the negro of the tobacconist-shops. Scattered amongst
    these man-eaters, and possibly the aborigines of the country, are
    comparatively dwarfish tribes, evidently the crane-fighting Pygmies of
    Homer and Herodotus, now known from their various clans, Aká, Tikitiki,
    Doko, Wambilikimo (two-cubiters), and so forth. Both the dwarfs and the
    (comparative) giants, of whom the Mpángwe, or Fans, first became known
    in Europe, are metal workers, and both work well. They despise arms
    and tools that chip and snap, and therefore prefer to ours, with ample
    reason, their charcoal-smelted native produce, and they temper it by
    many successive heatings and hammerings without water-quenching.<a id="FNanchor_521" href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a>
    According to Major Serpa Pinto (ii. 128) the Barotse temper their iron
    with ox-grease<a id="FNanchor_522" href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a> and salt. He notes, however (ii. 356), that the
    Ganguellas ‘manufacture steel out of wrought iron, tempered by cold
    water, into which the metal is thrown while hot.’</p>

  <p>The Gaboon river also produces the Babanga<a id="FNanchor_523" href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a> (?), a leaf-shaped
    Sword with a square end, made at Batta, and used by the Mpángwe; a
    Glaive also leaf-shaped with a long handle, having a point at the butt
    end, and Swords with triangular blades more or less broadened at the
    apex.</p>

  <p>Upon the glorious Congo river<a id="FNanchor_524" href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> I was shown a Sword belonging to the
    Mijolos or Mijeres, a tribe inhabiting the upper valley. All declared
    it to be of native make, and used during the Sword-dance performed in
    presence of the Prince. But it is an evident copy of some weapon of the
    fifteenth century; and the knightly model, like that of the Mpángwe
    (Fan) crossbow, had drifted into the African interior. The handle and
    its pommel were of ivory (in poorer weapons wood is used): the guard
    was a thin bar of iron springing from the junction of blade and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>grip;
    forming an open oval-shaped <i lang="fr">pas d’âne</i> below, and prolonged upwards
    and downwards in two quillons or branches, parallel with the hilt and
    protecting the hand. The blade, which had a tang for hefting, was
    straight, flexible, and double-edged.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>AFRICAN SWORDS.</i></div>

  <p>In the Despotism of Unyoro, on the northern shores of the (Victoria)
    Nyanza Lake, Sir Samuel Baker found a knife of the Egyptian leaf-shape,
    the <i lang="it">Lingua di Bove</i> of the Italians. The blade has a high mid-rib, and
    the handle is whipped round with copper wire. It is evidently used,
    like the Somal weapon, for stabbing as well as cutting.</p>

    <div class="caption smcap">Fig. 183.—Zanzibar Swords.</div>
  </div>

  <p>The Arabs of Zanzibar preserve the old two-handed weapon of Europe,
    with a thin, flattish, double-edged blade ending in a bevelled point,
    and much resembling the executioner’s Sword prolonged. They bear the
    Solingen mark. Zanzibar, however, has two Swords. The shorter weapon
    (<i>a</i>, fig. 183) is three-grooved and single-edged, the blade measuring
    one foot ten inches; the handle and sheath are of copper, embossed or
    engraved, and adorned with fine stones. The second (<i>b</i>, fig. 183),
    which is the usual shape carried by Arab gentlemen, is three feet to
    three and a half feet long; the long tang tapers towards the hilt,
    and is cased in wood and leather; the pommel is cylindrical, and the
    grip wants guard and quillons. Demmin (p. 396) finds it ‘difficult to
    understand how this singular weapon could be wielded.’ It serves mostly
    for show, and when wanted is used like a quarterstaff with both hands.
    But the Zanzibari’s Sword is always clumsy, as dangerous to the wielder
    as the old blade of the Gauls and Ancient Britons. Their cousins, the
    Bedawin living about Maskat, have conserved with a religious respect,
    many ancient weapons won or bought in older days, and possibly dating
    from crusading times. These valuable articles travelled far: the
    Portuguese found amongst the Moors of Malacca ‘Swords bearing in Latin
    the inscription “God help me.”’</p>

  <p>The Sword is also known to the blood-stained Despotisms that border
    the West Coast of Africa—Ashanti, Dahome, and Benin. Many of the
    shapes are borrowed: such are the Maroccan Yataghan, the Turkish or
    rather Persian Scymitar, and the Malay Krís (crease). Provided with
    silver hilts and scabbard mountings, they are generally wrapped in
    cloths, showing only the upper part of the sheath and grip.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span> Some of
    the forms have developed till they look almost original, especially the
    short broad blades pierced with holes like fish-slicers, and ending
    in circinal curves. They suggest the well-known Indian choppers, and
    probably in both countries they derive from Egypt. In Ashanti-land
    and Dahome they are mostly of iron, some are of brass, and others
    of gold;<a id="FNanchor_525" href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> and they are fantastically punched <span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>into chevrons and
    pierced with open-work. These ‘fish-slicers’ are used in sacrifice and
    in beheading, an operation which they perform very badly. Mr. Henry M.
    Stanley<a id="FNanchor_526" href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a> refers to ‘long-handled cleaver-like weapons’ amongst the
    savages of Makongo; and to iron bill-hooks and ‘massive cleaver-looking
    knives with polished blades’ in Karagwé.</p>

  <p>Gezo,<a id="FNanchor_527" href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a> the warrior king of Dahome or Ffon-land, who loved variety

    European razor on a large scale, with a steel of thirty inches <span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>rising
    from a plain handle of black wood, and kept open by a spring. It was

  </div>

  <p>My friend Captain Cameron<a id="FNanchor_528" href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a> gives interesting details concerning the
    Sword in parts of Africa which he first visited, and he has kindly sent
    me a specimen of the Manyuema (Maniwema) Swordlet drawn to scale. He
    describes the Wahumla tribe as using double-edged blades of iron shaped
    like those of the Roman legionary. The chiefs adorn their steel blades
    with neat open-work in various patterns, and some carry a fringe of
    bells all along the lower side of the sheath. The belt of twisted hide
    loops into a rolled fur (often otter-skin), and ends in two bells: it
    is slung over the left shoulder. The Rehombo chiefs use similar blades
    with broad and crescent-shaped edges; the commoners are armed with
    heavy spears, and short knives, also used when feeding.</p>

  <p>The people of the central Copper-lands<a id="FNanchor_529" href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a> have only long knives
    shaped like spear-heads. Stanley (ii. 81) calls them ‘short Swords
    scabbarded with wood, to which are hung small brass and iron
    bells.’ The Swords used by the chiefs under ‘King Kasongo’ are left
    undescribed:<a id="FNanchor_530" href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a> these weapons appear to be like those seen by me on
    the Congo. These negroes have a kind of sham attack in honour, a custom
    well known amongst the Bedawin. ‘When sufficiently bedaubed’ (with
    pipeclay or cinnabar) ‘the chief returned the bag to his boy, and,
    drawing his Sword, rushed at Kasongo, seemingly intent upon cutting
    him down; but just before reaching him, he suddenly fell on his knees,
    driving the Sword into the ground and rubbing his forehead in the dust.’</p>

  <p>The Poucue (Pokwé) of the Lunda chiefs is not allowed to the people.
    This weapon (fig. 191) has also found its way from Egypt into lands far
    south of the Equator, and may be traced in the dagger-formed knives of
    the Ovampos. It <span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>is a large two-edged knife, three spans long by four
    inches broad: the sheath is of leather, and the weapon hangs under the
    left arm.<a id="FNanchor_531" href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a> The Pokwé not a little resembles the short leaf-shaped
    iron blades from the Gaboon River, West Africa; and these again suggest
    the Swords and the spear-heads of the ‘Bronze Age.’ Stanley (ii. 228)
    shows the ‘Baswa knife’ on the Upper Congo exactly resembling the
    Pokwé; these weapons ‘vary in size from a butcher’s cleaver to a lady’s
    dirk’ (?). He also found ‘splendid long knives, like Persian Kummars’
    (Khanjars?) and ‘bill-hook Swords.’</p>

  </div>

  <p>The Habshi people inhabiting Janjhíra (El Jezírah = the island),
    off the West Coast of India, south of Bombay, retain a curious
    relic of their African origin. These negroids, who call themselves
    Abyssinians, are originally Wásawáhíli from Zanzibar. Their cleaver
    is a straightened Khopsh wholly of iron, handle, plain cross-guard
    and pommel (fig. 193). The blade is fifteen inches broad, the back
    is an inch and a half thick, and the weapon is as heavy as a man can
    wield. These ex-pirates, under the Habshi Nawwáb, are still feared,
    on account of their great strength<a id="FNanchor_532" href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a> and violent temper, by all
    their effeminate Indian neighbours. It is well to note that in case of
    another ‘Indian Mutiny,’ we can easily raise on the eastern coast of
    Africa a negroid force sufficient to put it down.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Colonel A. Lane-Fox<a id="FNanchor_533" href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a> remarks that one of the most peculiar forms
    of Sword <span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>used in Africa is the corrugated, having an ogee-section.
    On each face a portion of the blade is sunk on one side only, and
    on the other face the depression is on the reverse side. Thus the
    transverse section somewhat resembles the angles of the letter Z. We
    can understand the use of this device when adapted to the pile of the
    arrow or the javelin. It would give the weapon a rotatory motion on
    the principle of the screw-propeller, the action being only reversed
    instead of the screw propelling itself by acting upon the surrounding
    medium: in this case the air impinges upon the screw flanges and
    rotates the arrow, thereby increasing the accuracy of its flight.
    But the peculiarity has been preserved where it is wholly useless;
    and, curious to say, this ogee-form is persistent in all the Swords
    obtained from the Caucasus, while the iron blades of Saxon and Frankish
    spears discovered in the graves of England and France have the same
    distinctive. Both may have derived it from Egypt: the Caucasians
    through Colchis, and Western Europe by means of the Phœnicians. The
    illustration is taken from the ‘Pagan Saxondom’ of Mr. J. Y. Akerman,
    who was the first to draw attention to the strange resemblance between
    the Saxon and Hottentot spears.<a id="FNanchor_534" href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a></p>

  <p>Thus we see that whilst Egypt originated the three shapes of
    Sword-blades—straight, curved, and half-curved—the rest of Africa
    invented positively nothing in hoplology. Negroids and negroes either
    borrowed their weapons from Egypt or imported them from beyond the sea.
    Intertropical Africa never imagined an alphabet, a plough, or a Sword.</p>

    (Khatte);<a id="FNanchor_536" href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a> he makes them dwell on ‘the upper Ocean of the Setting
    Sun.’ The Greeks translated from Hebrew <span lang="grc">Γῆ Χεττιεὶμ</span>, and termed the
    race <span lang="grc">Χεττιὶμ</span> and <span lang="grc">Χεττεινί</span>. They are the <span lang="grc">ἑταῖροι Κήτειοι</span> (Keteian or

    Eurypylus, was slain with ‘the copper’ (Sword), and of whom many
    perished around him ‘on account of gifts to a woman.’</p>

  <p>The cradle of this race, which took the lead of Western Asia during
    the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, was the
    rolling prairie between the Orontes and the Euphrates. Joshua
    represents the Lord saying: ‘From the wilderness and this Lebanon
    even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of
    the Hittites, and unto the great sea toward the going down of the
    sun, shall be your coast’ (i. 4). In their palmy days they covered
    the interval between Egypt and Assyria, extending northwards to
    Phrygia and Cilicia; eastwards to Mesopotamia and westwards to the
    Mediterranean. They had walled and fortified cities as ‘Tunep or Tunipa
    (Daphne) in the land Naharayn’<a id="FNanchor_538" href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a>—the latter here <span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>meaning Upper

    or Khilibu (Aleppo);<a id="FNanchor_539" href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a> Kazantana (Gozanitis); Nishiba (Nisipis)
    and Patena, which gave rise to ‘Padan-Aram’ and to ‘Batanæa.’ Their
    northern capital was Carchemish (the Gr. Hierapolis and the modern
    Yaráblus),<a id="FNanchor_540" href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a> on the Euphrates, lately explored: some explain the
    word as ‘Kar’ (town of) ‘Chemish’ the Moab-god); others by ‘Khem’ or
    ‘Chemmis,’ the Egyptian Pan. It was captured by Sargon (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
    717), and became the head-quarters of an Assyrian Satrapy. Their
    sacred city was Kadesh (<span lang="grc">Κάδης</span>, the holy), a synonym of El-Kuds, the
    Arabic name for Jerusalem; and even of the City of David it was said
    (Ezek. xvi. 3), ‘her father was an Amorite and her mother a Hittite.’
    A Hittite tribe extended to the southernmost frontiers of Palestine
    (Gen. xxiii. <i>passim</i>); Hebron, one of their settlements, was founded,
    we are told, seven years before Zoan (‘a station for loading animals’),
    <i>alias</i> San or Tanis, the capital of the Egyptian ‘Shepherd-Kings.’ But
    the allusion must be to Sesostris-Ramses (II.), who also made San his
    capital under the name of ‘Pi- (city of) Ramessu,’ not to the original
    building by King Pepi of the Sixth Dynasty, who preceded Abraham by a
    thousand years.</p>

  <p>The Hittites were governed by twelve ‘kings,’ probably satraps, under
    the Khita-sir or supreme chief. The ‘kings of the Hittites’ are
    mentioned as joining the Egyptians (2 Kings iii. 6).<a id="FNanchor_541" href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a> Although the
    Hebrews were ordered utterly to destroy the race, their books prove
    that the Khita were often in intimate relation with the intruders,
    as in the case of Uriah the Hittite, one of the thirty of David’s
    body-guard. They worshipped Baal Sutech (Sutekh) the War-god, the
    ‘man of war,’ a counterpart of Amun, with his wife (Sakti or active
    energy), Astartha-Anata, and they also venerated Targatha, Derketo
    or Atargatis—two Syro-Greek words for one and the same person.
    The Egyptians at times rank the Khita as a ‘great people,’ and
    their habitat as a ‘great country’; holding them, in fact, almost
    as their peers: they also speak with reverence of their gods. Like
    their neighbours of Kemi, the ‘Hittites’ were a literary nation: the
    monuments of Nile-land mention a certain Kirab-sar (or sir), ‘writer of
    the books of the Chief of the Khita,’ and the determinative is papyrus
    or parchment. Hebron was also originally called Kirjath- (Kariyat)
    Sepher’—settlement of books.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span></p>

  <p>The Khita were formidable opponents to Kemi between the seventeenth and
    the fourteenth centuries <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> They fought doughtily against
    Thut-mes III. (<i>circa</i> <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 1600) during his Syrian campaign,
    when this ‘Alexander the Great of Egyptian history’ overthrew the
    chief of Kadesh, built a fortress on the Lebanon-range and mastered
    ‘Naharayn.’<a id="FNanchor_542" href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> Three centuries later, Kadesh was taken by Osirei or
    Seti I. (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 1366). A few years afterwards took place the
    great campaign of his son,<a id="FNanchor_543" href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a> Ramses II., or the Great, ‘who made
    Egypt anew,’ and who is famous as the Sesostris of Herodotus.<a id="FNanchor_544" href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a>
    He was nearly defeated at the historic battle of ‘Kadesh, the
    wicked’;<a id="FNanchor_545" href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a> but at last he succeeded in ‘throwing the foe one upon
    another, head over heels into the waters of the Orontes.’ Wilkinson
    (i. 400) shows a city with a double moat, crossed by two bridges: at
    the outer defence, formed by the river running into a lake, a phalanx
    of the Khita is drawn up as a reserve corps. ‘Wonderfully rich,’ says
    Brugsch, ‘is the great picture which represents the fight of the
    chariots: while the gigantic form of Ramses,<a id="FNanchor_546" href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a> in the very midst
    of the hostile war-cars, performs deeds of derring-do, astonishing
    friend and foe, his gallant son, Prahiunamif, commander-in-chief of
    the charioteers, heads the attack upon those of the enemy. The Khita
    warriors are thrown into the river, and among them is the King of
    Khilibi (Aleppo), whom the warriors try to revive by holding his legs
    in the air with his head hanging down.’<a id="FNanchor_547" href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a> This was the victory that
    gave birth to the first of Epic poems, the ‘Song of Pentaur the Scribe.’</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span></p>
  <div class="sidenote"><i>THE HITTITE SWORD.</i></div>

  <p>The war ended by the Egyptian marrying the Hittite’s daughter, and
    making with his father-in-law a highly-civilised extradition treaty
    engraved upon a silver plate.<a id="FNanchor_548" href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a> Another invasion, however, took
    place (circa <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 1200) under Ramses III. This ‘Rhampsinitus’
    of the Greeks, a compound title, Ramessu-pa-Neter (Ramses the god), has
    left inscriptions concerning his ‘Campaign of Vengeance’ which cover
    one side of the temple of Medinah Habu:<a id="FNanchor_549" href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a> amongst the conquered foes
    appears the ‘miserable King of Khita as a living prisoner.’</p>

  <p>In later times the Khita became well known to Assyrian story.<a id="FNanchor_550" href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a>
    Shalmaneser II. (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 884–852) mentions the ‘Hittites and
    the city of Petra’ (Pethor); he takes ‘eighty-nine cities of the land
    of the Hamathites,’ and Rimonidri of Damascus. Tiglath-pileser II.
    (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 745–727) speaks of the ‘city of Hamatti’ (Hamath) and
    the ‘Arumu’ (Aramæans).</p>

  <p>According to Wilkinson (I. chap. v.) the Khita are represented on the
    monuments, the Memnonium, Medinah Habu, and elsewhere, as a shaven race
    with light red skins. Their dress is the long Assyrian robe falling to
    the ankles: the hair is crisply curled and at times covered with the
    tall cap of Phrygian type. A characteristic article, which appears in
    their hieroglyphs, is the pointed and upturned boot,<a id="FNanchor_551" href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a> somewhat like
    the soleret of the sixteenth century. For armour they had square or
    oblong shields and quilted coats with bracelets defending their arms.
    Their weapons were bows, spears, and the short straight Sword, the
    modern flesh-chopper, then in use among their rival neighbours of the
    Nile Valley.</p>

  <p>These gallant Canaanites<a id="FNanchor_552" href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a> were proficients in the art of war. The
    army was distributed into foot and mounted men. The former consisted
    of a native nucleus called Tuhir (Táhir?),<a id="FNanchor_553" href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a> the ‘chosen ones,’
    and a host of mercenaries under Hir-pits or captains. Amongst these
    were the Shardana, Sardones, commonly translated Sardinians; Brugsch
    contends that they were Colchians, and derives from them ‘Sardonian
    linen.’ They were armed with horned helmets and round shields, spears
    and long Swords. The Kelau or slingers appear to have been a <i lang="fr">corps
    d’élite</i> that waited upon the Prince.<a id="FNanchor_554" href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a> The tactics included a
    regular phalanx, a herse or <span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>column of spearsmen like the Egyptian;
    and, although the cavalry rode horses their ‘strength was in chariots.’</p>

  <p>‘Hithism’<a id="FNanchor_555" href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a> became a study of late years, after the publication of
    ‘Hittite hieroglyphs,’ first discovered at Hamah, then at Aleppo, gave
    it an impulse. Two rock-inscriptions with bas-reliefs were discovered
    by the Rev. E. Davis (of Alexandria) at Ibriz (Áb-ríz), three hours
    south of Eregli, the old Cybistra on the great Lycaonian plain.<a id="FNanchor_556" href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a>
    The finds at Carchemish added to the scanty store, and there are said
    to be Hittite seals in the British Museum. In Dr. Schliemann’s ‘Troy’
    (p. 352), I find a Hittite hieroglyph on the stamped terra-cotta; the
    middle figure to the right is apparently the fist or fist-shaped glove,
    the Egyptian symbol of the hand. I shall presently notice the Lycian
    coin and a gold incision from Cyprus. Three legible characters—the
    bull’s head, the cap, and the bent arm—are traced to the so-called
    prehistoric statue of Niobe, Mount Sipylus. Evidently Hittite, too, is
    the bronze tablet in M. Peretié’s Museum, Bayrut.<a id="FNanchor_557" href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a></p>

  <p>Modern discoveries enable us to characterise Hittite art as a blending
    of Egyptian with Assyrian, or rather Babylonian, both considerably
    modified. The former appears in the two sphinxes of Eyub, and in
    the winged solar disk, which was also borrowed by Mesopotamia from
    the Nile Valley. The bas-reliefs and gems of Assyria are reflected
    in the Hittite representations of the human figure; but the stature
    is shorter, the limbs are thicker and more rounded, and the muscles
    are not so prominent. At Boghaz-Keui some of the deities stand upon
    animals, a posture believed to be early Babylonian.<a id="FNanchor_558" href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> Here, too, the
    goddesses wear mural crowns, the decoration of the Ephesian Artemis,
    and Prof. Sayce thence infers its Hittite origin. At Eyub is found the
    double-headed eagle which is supposed to be the prototype of the old
    Siljukian and modern European monsters.<a id="FNanchor_559" href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a></p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>HITTITE HIEROGLYPHICS.</i></div>

  <p>The Hittite syllabary has systematic affinities with the Egyptian, as
    shown by the boot, the glove (or hand), the bent arm, the battle-axe,
    and the short straight chopper-knife. But before reading these
    ideographs it was necessary to determine the language, and here
    difficulties arose. Prof. Sayce denies that the Khita were Semites
    or spoke a Semitic tongue;<a id="FNanchor_560" href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a> and in this he is followed by Mr.
    W. St. Chad Boscawen. But the former contended with scant success,
    that the Cypriote <span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>writing was ‘none other than the hieroglyphics
    of Hamath.’<a id="FNanchor_561" href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a> Mr. Hyde Clarke believes that Khita, Etruscan, and
    Cypriote are kindred tongues; and detects their symbols upon the
    autonomous coins of Spain. Others have supported the Scythic (Turanian)
    origin of the Hittites: in our day this was inevitable. The Rev. Dunbar
    I. Heath bravely pronounces the language Semitic and made a gallant
    attempt at interpreting the syllabary.<a id="FNanchor_562" href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a> But nothing final can be
    done under present conditions: we have not even collected all the
    characters.<a id="FNanchor_563" href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a></p>

  <p>While the Khita were inlanders, the parallel shore-land of the
    Mediterranean—Syria and Palestine—was occupied by a host of Semitic
    and congener tribes. The former is a noble word and by no means the
    ‘invention of a Greek geographer’; Suríyyah denotes the rocky region
    from Sur or Tsur (<span lang="he">זור</span> = rock), a tower (<i>turris</i>), Tyre, the Zurai of
    Tiglath-pileser II., and the Tapau of the hieroglyphs. Thus ‘Syria’
    and ‘Tyria’ would be synonyms. Herodotus (vii. 63) fathered a sad
    confusion when he wrote, ‘The people whom the Greeks call Syrians are
    called Assyrians by the barbarians.’ Assyria is from another root, <span lang="he">אשר</span>
    (Ashur), supposed to signify ‘happiness,’ and applied, as will be seen,
    to one of the gods. Syria is the hieroglyphic Khar, Kharu, or Khálu,
    the ‘hinder-land,’ that is, behind or north of Osiris (Egypt), and
    the Akarru or Akharu of the cuneiforms, both from the ‘Semitic’ root
    Akhr. ‘Palestine’ (Syria) is simply the ‘land of the Philistines,’ the
    Zahi of the hieroglyphs and mediæval Filistín; this powerful family,
    probably connected with the Hyksos, extended eastward from the confines
    of Egypt, and built Pelusium—‘Philistine-town,’ not town of <span lang="grc">πηλὸς</span> or
    mud.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span></p>

  <p>Beyond the Philistines began the Phœnicians—merchants and traders,
    travellers, explorers, and colonisers—the ‘Englishmen of antiquity.’
    When Herodotus brings the Phœnicians from the ‘Erythrean Sea’ he is
    generally understood to mean the Persian Gulf, where the islands of
    Tyrus (or Tylos) and Aradus are supposed to be the mother-sites of
    the homonymous Mediterranean settlements. The popular derivation of
    ‘Phœnicia’ is from <span lang="grc">φοῖνιξ</span>, which again may have been, <i>more Græco</i>,
    a mere translation of the Egyptian Kefeth, Kefthu, Keft, and Kefa, a
    palm-tree. But the question would be solved if it can be proved that
    the Phœnicians are the ‘Fenekh’<a id="FNanchor_564" href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> of the monuments and the Moslem
    El-Fenish. Mariette Pasha derived the term Punoi, Pœni, from Pun or
    Punt, by which he understood Somali-land; he is easily reconciled with
    Herodotus by assuming Punt to mean, as most understand it, the opposite
    Arabian coast.<a id="FNanchor_565" href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a> Thus the ‘Port of Punt’ is the mythical Red Sea
    (primordial matter?), where red Typhon and the red dragon App or Apáp
    (Apophis) fought against the white god Horus—the prototype of Baldur
    the Beautiful.<a id="FNanchor_566" href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a></p>

  <p>The Phœnicians left their mark upon the world. For many generations the
    Mediterranean was a ‘Phœnician lake,’ and they could boast of a general
    <span lang="grc">θαλασσοκρατία</span>. This enabled their merchants and navigators to diffuse
    civilisation from Egypt and Assyria to the farthest West. They were
    the carriers of the world. Their ‘round ships’ or merchantmen (<span lang="grc">γαυλοί</span>)
    and their long war-ships pushed far into the Northern and Southern
    Atlantic. The topographical lists of Thut-mes III. show a thickly
    inhabited country (Brugsch, i. 350–51), and, as Mariette Pasha says, a
    map of Canaan, composed of some hundred and fifteen hieroglyphic names,
    ‘is a synoptical table of the “Promised Land,” made two hundred and
    seventy years before the exodus of Moses.’ Among the settlements are
    Debekhu, now Baalbak, the Baal-city;<a id="FNanchor_567" href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a> Tum-sakhu, the gate or shrine
    of Tum, the setting sun, now Damascus; Biarut (<i>hod.</i> Bayrut); Keriman
    or Mount Carmel and Iopoo, Joppa, or Jaffa. We find the Jordan in the
    Egyptian Iarutana, and Shabatuan is the Sabbaticus River of Pliny and
    Josephus.<a id="FNanchor_568" href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a></p>

  <p>The chief cities of Phœnicia, Tyre and Sidon, were of unexampled
    splendour, depôts of the wealth of the East, as early as <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
    1500. The arch-Homerid, who curiously enough never mentions Tyre,
    attributes all the finest works of art either <span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>to the Sidonians or
    to the gods. The eastern coast of the ‘Inner Sea’ was a centre of
    civilisation, a school of high culture which added beauty to necessary
    and useful technical products; and its arts and handicrafts became
    patterns to the world, even to Egypt, the mother. We have only a few
    inscriptions to remind us of its literature; but nothing can be more
    touching or more poetical than the epitaph of Eshmunazar, King of the
    Sidonians:<a id="FNanchor_569" href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a>—‘Deprived of my fruit of life, my wise and valiant
    sons; widowed, the child of solitude, I lie in this tomb, in this
    grave, in the place which I built,’ &amp;c. Phœnicia, too, gave not only
    her letters but her gods to Greece and Rome. Mulciber, for instance,
    was evidently Malik Kabir, the ‘Great King,’ father of the Cabiri, the
    patron-saints of Palm-land and the Pelasgi; this deity corresponded
    with the Egyptian Ptah, the Demiurgus-god denoted by the Scarabæus, a
    symbol as common in Phœnicia as in Nile-land. Melkarth,<a id="FNanchor_570" href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a> again,
    whom Nonnius makes the Babylonian Sun, was the city-god; farther west
    he became Herakles, the Etruscan Erkle: the latter was an important
    commercial personage in Phœnicia, for his dog (according to the Greeks)
    discovered the murex. Melkarth is the Ourshol of Selden (‘De Diis
    Syriis’), who derives the word from ‘Ur,’ light.<a id="FNanchor_571" href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a></p>

  <p>Another Syrian people, often occurring upon the Egyptian monuments, is
    the Shairetana, whom Layard supposes to be the Sharutinians near modern
    Antioch. They inhabited a country upon a river and a lake or sea.
    Their armour was a close-fitting cuirass of imbricated metal plates,
    worn over a short dress and girt at the waist; the helmet had side
    horns, and its upper dome was surmounted by a shaft-and-ball crest.
    Their weapons were javelins, long spears, and pointed Swords. The
    Tokkari, their neighbours, also carried for offence spears and large
    pointed knives or straight Swords. The Rebo had bows and long straight
    Swords with very sharp points. The same is the case with Ru-tennu or
    Rot-n-n, who often pass in review upon the monuments. They appear to
    have contained two divisions: the Ru-tennu-hir (upper Ru-tennu) were
    apparently the peoples of Cœlesyria, while the Ruthens or Luthens are
    mentioned in conjunction with Neniee (Nineveh), Shinar (Singar), Babel,
    and other places in Eastern Naharayn (Mesopotamia).</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>THE HARPE OF PERSEUS.</i></div>

  <p>We have no knowledge of the Phœnician Sword except that supplied to us
    by the legend of the enigmatical Egypto-Argive hero, Perseus. According
    to Herodotus (ii. 91), his quadrangular fane was at Panopolis-Chemmis
    in the Theban nome: here his sandal, two cubits long, was shown to
    devotees; and the land prospered whenever he appeared, as is the
    case when it sees El-Khizr, the Green Prophet of El-Islam. The
    Greeks, whom we need not credit, made him the son of Jupiter by the
    ‘Acrisian maid’ (Danaë); and the Persians,<a id="FNanchor_572" href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a> according to the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>Greeks, declared his son Perses to be the <i>heros eponymus</i> of their
    country, and the ancestor of their Hakhmanish or Achæmenian kings.
    His chief exploits were two. At Spanish Tartessus or in Libya (Herod.
    ii. 91) he slew, with the aid of a ‘magic mirror’ given to him by
    Neith-Athene, the gorgon Medusa, that old Typhonian head, from whose
    neck sprang Pegasus and Chrysaor.<a id="FNanchor_573" href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a> At Phœnician Joppa (Jaffa)<a id="FNanchor_574" href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a>
    he slaughtered the sea-monster (<span lang="grc">κῆτος</span>) and saved ‘Andromeda,’ who is
    suspiciously like ‘Anat.’</p>

  <p>In both these feats Perseus used a celestial weapon, the Harpé of
    Cronos, which Zeus had wielded in his duel with Typhon. The giant or
    bad-god had torn it from the grip of the good-god, whom he presently
    imprisoned in a cave; and it was not recovered till the captive was
    liberated by Thut-Hermes. The Greeks call this Sword <span lang="grc">Ἅρπη</span> (Harpé),<a id="FNanchor_575" href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a>
    and the name is evidently the Phœnician Hereba and the Hebrew Chereb;
    whilst its description, <span lang="grc">δρέπανον ὀξὺ</span> (<i>falx acuta</i>, sharp sickle),
    identifies it with the Khopsh-blade of Egypt. Perseus performed his two
    exploits as Hercules slew the Lernæan hydra; and Mercury cut off the
    head of Argus (<i>falcato ense</i>), using the <i>harpen Cyllenida</i>.<a id="FNanchor_576" href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a></p>

  <p>This legend has greatly ‘exercised’ commentators. The hero is connected
    with Io, Belus, and Ægyptus; while he is evidently related to the
    Cypriot Perseuth and the Phœnician Reseph<a id="FNanchor_577" href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a> (flame or thunderbolt).
    The original fight is the eternal warfare of good, light, warmth,
    joy, with their contraries. It begins with Osiris-Typhon; it proceeds
    to Assyria, where Bel the Sun-god attacks the Tiamat or marine
    monster with the Sapara-Sword or Khopsh. In Persia it becomes Hormuzd
    (Ahura-mazda) and Ahriman (Angra-manus): in Jewry it is an affair
    between Bel and the Dragon; in Greece between Apollo and Python. The
    duello is continued by St. Patrick,<a id="FNanchor_578" href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a> who banished for ever snakes
    from Ireland; and it makes its final appearance as ‘Saint George
    and the Dragon.’ This expiring effort of Egyptian mythology is held
    apocryphal by the Roman Catholic Church, and no wonder. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>Dragons do
    not, and never did, exist, except in memory as prehistoric monsters;
    moreover, the traveller in Syria is shown three several tombs of
    ‘Már Jiryús’ the Cappadocian, a saint who has spread himself from
    Diospolis-Lydda throughout the world. Under Justinian, the Theseum of
    Athens was dedicated to ‘Saint George of Cappadocia,’ and in Cyprus he
    had as many temples as Venus. The Saxon teacher thus invoked him:</p>

    unsurpassed even by his industry. A bas-relief group in the Louvre
    shows the hawk-headed Horus, mounted and in Roman uniform, piercing
    with his peculiar spear (an <i>hamatum</i>, or barb-head), the neck of the
    crocodile Typhon, Set, Dagon,<a id="FNanchor_580" href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a> Python—the Devil. This strongly
    suggests that Horus and Perseus, Saint Patrick and Saint George, are
    one and the same person.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>PHŒNICIAN SWORDS.</i></div>

  <p>The Hereba-blade has not yet been found in Phœnicia, but Wilkinson
    argues (II. ch. vii.) that the beautiful Swords and daggers, buried
    with the Ancient Britons and clearly not of Greek or Roman type, are
    Phœnician work. Carthaginian blades, however, dug up at Cannæ are now
    in the British Museum.<a id="FNanchor_581" href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a> That the nations were congeners we see by
    the Pœnulus of Plautus, and by such names as Dido (another form of
    David) and Elissa (El-Isá, the royal woman); by Sichæus, who derives
    from the same root as Zacchæus; by Hannibal and Hasdrubal (containing
    the root Ba’al), and by the ‘Suffetes’—magistrates who are the Hebrew
    Shophetim or Judges.<a id="FNanchor_582" href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a> The mercenary armies of Carthage, whose
    conquests are first alluded to by Herodotus (vii. 165), used Swords of
    bronze, copper, and tin: Meyrick (i. 7) also mentions brass; and the
    highly imaginative General Vallancey compares it with Dowris metal or
    ‘Irish brass.’ Dr. Schliemann (‘Mycenæ,’ p. 76) picked up, at ‘Motyë
    in Sicily,’ Carthaginian piles (arrow-heads) of bronze, pyramidal and
    without barbs (<span lang="grc">γλωχῖνες</span> or <i>hami</i>); he found the same style at Mycenæ
    (p. 123).</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span></p>

  <p>The Swords of the Lycians probably resembled the Egyptian Khopsh; and
    the same was the case with the Cilician falchion. The latter peoples
    were also armed with the <span lang="grc">σάρισσα</span> (Sarissa); the lance or spear, sixteen
    to twenty feet long, afterwards used by the people of Epirus and the
    Macedonian phalanx. It is opposed to the Larissa, the lance of the
    European Middle Ages, and to the Narissa affected by the Norrenses.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>THE JEWISH SWORD.</i></div>

  <p>The most remarkable point concerning the Sword amongst the ancient
    Hebrews is our practical ignorance of its shape and size. Although
    shekels and similar remains have been discovered in fair quantities,
    that ‘iron race in iron clad,’ the Jews of old, has not left us a
    single specimen of arms or armour. This is the more curious, as we are
    expressly told that the blade was buried with its wielder.<a id="FNanchor_583" href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a> And
    although we are assured (Gen. iv. 22) that Tubal-Cain, son of Lamech
    and Zillah, was the first metal-smith, there is no direct mention of
    iron arms amongst the Jews till after the Exodus. Gesenius proposes
    to make Tubal-Cain a hybrid word, ‘scoriarum faber,’ from the Persian
    ‘Tupal’ (iron-slag or scoriæ), and ‘Kani’ (<i>faber</i>, a blacksmith). He
    has been identified with Ptah, Bil-Kan (Assyria), Vulcan, and Mulciber;
    and only ignorance of Hinduism prevented mediæval commentators
    discovering him under the <i>alias</i> of Vishvamitra, the artificer of the
    Hindú gods. Maestro Vizani (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1588), a famous master of
    fence, attributes the invention of the Sword to Tubal-Cain; we should
    now place this worthy in the later bronze and early iron age. Unjust
    claims to discovery are made by all ancient peoples; and here it would
    be hardly fair to adduce Bochart’s ‘Judæi semper mendaces; in hoc
    argumento potissimum mentiuntur liberalissime.’</p>

  <p>It is, however, amply evident that the Phœnicians and the despised
    Canaanites were highly-cultivated peoples, whereas the Jews were not.
    The latter are never alluded to in Egyptian hieroglyphs.<a id="FNanchor_584" href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a> Even
    after they had established their principality upon the bleak and
    barren uplands of Judæa, they were dependent for their art upon their
    neighbours. Although gold was so abundant in the days of David that he
    could collect about one thousand million pounds (one hundred thousand
    talents of gold and one million of silver) for building the Temple,
    yet Solomon, the Wise King, was obliged to seek stone-cutters and even
    carpenters among the <span lang="grc">Σίδονες πολυδαίδαλοι</span>. Judæa had neither science
    nor art; architecture, sculpture, paintings nor mosaics; comfort nor
    cookery. The Great Temple that succeeded the Tabernacle of Moses was
    mainly the work of Hiram of Tyre, the Siromus of Herodotus (v. 104),
    the Hiromus of Dius, Menander and Josephus (‘Apion,’ i. 17, &amp;c.), and
    probably a dynastic name, as ‘Haram’ the Sacred.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span></p>

  <p>Another learned master of arms<a id="FNanchor_585" href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a> declares that the first weapon
    mentioned in Hebrew Holy Writ is the <i>flammeus gladius</i> wielded by the
    Cherubim (Gen. iii. 24), the ‘Chereb’ which the Septuagint renders
    <span lang="grc">Ῥομφαία</span>.<a id="FNanchor_586" href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a> On the Assyrian monuments the Kerubi (‘cherub,’ which
    derives, like the Arabic ‘Karrúb,’ from ‘Karb’ = propinquity) denotes
    the colossal figures symbolising the Powers of Good, and guarding the
    palace-gates. As they prevented the admission of Evil, they found
    their way to the entrance of the Garden of Eden, whence they warned
    off sinners and intruders. The ‘flaming Sword,’ which ‘turned every
    way to keep the way of the tree of life,’ was, according to some, the
    two-pronged blade, the Greek ‘chelidonian,’ which served as a talisman.
    Tiglath Pileser I. made one of these forked Swords of copper, inscribed
    it with his victories, and placed it as a trophy in one of his castles.
    But the Genesitic Sword is probably the weapon-symbol of Merodach, the
    Babylonian god and planet Jupiter. This revolving disc represented,
    like the Aryan ‘Vajra,’ the lightning or ‘thunderbolt’ with which our
    classics armed Zeus-Jovi;<a id="FNanchor_587" href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a> and a highly poetical description of it
    is given in an old Akkadian hymn. Here it is called among other names
    <i>littu</i> (or <i>litu</i>), which is, letter for letter, the same as the first
    of the Hebrew words translated ‘flaming Sword’ (<i>lahat ha-Chereb</i>):
    it may also signify the ‘Burning of Desolation.’ M. F. Lenormant<a id="FNanchor_588" href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a>
    suggests that the true meaning is ‘magical prodigy.’ But it is safer
    to stand by the disc-like Sword, which corresponds with the wheels of
    Ezekiel’s vision (chap. x. 9, 10). In the Chaldæan battle of Bel and
    the Dragon we again find the great flaming Sword, turning all round the
    circle when wielded by the deity against the ‘Drake.’ So the Egyptians
    had long before depicted the solar god with a glory of solar rays, a
    most appropriate symbol; and his enemy, Apophis
    <img class="iglyph-4" src="images/i_183_s.png" alt="" width="85" height="25" />, the
    serpent of Genesis, whom he destroys, is a monstrous reptile bristling
    with a dorsal line of four Sword-blades, like flesh-knives, typifying
    destruction.</p>

  <p>The Hebrews borrowed their metallurgy, like all their early science,
    from Egypt. M. de Goguet remarked that they were not destitute of
    technological skill if they could calcine the golden calf and reduce
    the metal (probably by using natron) to a powder which could be drunk
    in water—<i lang="la">aurum potabile</i>.</p>

  <p>The Hebrews called the Sword ‘Chereb’ (<span lang="he">חרב</span>, pl. Chereboth), a word that
    occurs some two hundred and fifty times in the ‘Old Testament.’ Its
    root, like the Arabic ‘khrb,’ means to waste, to be wasted; and the
    noun denotes any wasting matter.<a id="FNanchor_589" href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a> Mostly it means a Sword (Gen.
    xvii. 40; xxxiv. 25, &amp;c. &amp;c.); in other <span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>places it is a knife (Josh. v.
    2, 3). So we find in Ezekiel (v. 1), ‘Take thee a sharp knife [Chereb];
    take thee a barber’s razor’: elsewhere it becomes a chisel (Exod.
    xx. 25); an axe or pick (Jer. xxxiv. 4; Ez. v. 1, and xxvi. 9), and,
    finally, violent heat (Job xxx. 30). The Arabic ‘Harbah’ signifies a
    dart.</p>

  <p>We gather from the Hebrew writings that the Sword was originally of
    copper: hence the allusion to its brightness and its glittering: this
    would be followed by bronze, and lastly by iron, ground upon the
    whetstone (Deut. xxxii. 41). It was not of flint; the ‘sharp knives’
    alluded to in Joshua (v. 2), were mere silex-flakes like the Egyptian.
    The Sword was used by foot-soldiers and horsemen, the latter adding to
    the ‘light Sword’ a ‘glittering spear’ (Nahum iii. 3). The ‘Chereb’
    was not a large or heavy weapon, and we may safely assume that its
    forms were those of the Egyptian hieroglyphs. The weight of Goliath’s
    Sword is unfortunately not given (1 Sam. xvii. 45), like that of his
    spear and his armour; nor are we told anything about the blade which
    David refused because he had not proved it (<i>ibid.</i> 39). But the ease
    with which the son of Jesse drew out of the sheath thereof and used
    the Philistine’s ‘Chereb,’ suggests a normal size and weight (<i>ibid.</i>
    51 and xxi. 9). It was much admired, for the victor said, ‘There is
    none like that’ (1 Sam. xxi. 9). From the same chapter and verse we
    learn that the blade was ‘wrapped up in a cloth,’ still an Eastern
    practice, ‘behind the ephod’ or priest’s robe.<a id="FNanchor_590" href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a> And the fact of a
    man falling upon his Sword (1 Sam. xxxi. 4, 5) shows that the blade
    was stiff, short, and straight, like the Egyptian leaf-blade. Ehud the
    Benjamite, when about to murder Eglon, King of Moab (Jud. iii. 16),
    ‘made a two-edged Sword-dagger of a cubit length’ (or eighteen inches),
    apparently without a sheath. The frequent mention of the double-edged
    Sword (or straight cut-and-thrust?) suggests that there were also
    single-edged blades, back-Swords or, perhaps, falchions. It is hard to
    understand why Meyrick tells us that the Jews wore the Sword ‘suspended
    in front, in the Asiatic style.’ Ehud (<i>ibid.</i> 16, 21) girt his weapon
    under his raiment upon his right thigh, and drew it with his left hand.
    Again, we read, ‘Gird thy sword upon thy thigh’ (Ps. xlv. 3); and as
    Joab proceeded to assassinate Amasa (2 Sam. xx. 8), the ‘garment that
    he had put on was girded unto him, and upon it a girdle with a sword
    fastened upon his loins in the sheath thereof; and as he went forth it
    fell out.’ The allusions to the oppressing Sword (Jer. xlvi. 16; l.
    25) recall the Assyrian emblem of the Sword and the Dove, which are
    both figured in one image. Perhaps we must so understand the Egyptian
    Ritual of the Dead: ‘I came forth as his child from his Sword.’
    Apparently the Chereb was worn, as by the civilised Greeks and Romans,
    only on emergencies and not, like the chivalry of Europe, habitually
    in peaceful towns. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>The Cultellarii or Sicarii, whom Josephus and
    Tacitus<a id="FNanchor_591" href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a> mention, were mere assassins, like the French Coustilliers
    and the English Coustrils or Custrils.</p>

  <p>That the Hebrews were not first-rate Sword-cutlers, we may infer from
    the history of Judas the Maccabee.<a id="FNanchor_592" href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a> A vision of Jeremiah the
    Prophet, preceding the victory over Nicanor, had promised him ‘a Sword
    of God, a holy Sword,’ not the short Machæra but the large Rhomphæa (2
    Mac. xv. 15). After his war with the Samaritans and the Gentiles of
    Palestine, ‘Judas took the Sword of Apollonius (the Syrian general) and
    fought with it all his life’ (2 Mac. iii. 12).</p>

  <p>And yet how general was the use of the Sword in Jewry we gather from
    the fact that it assisted in taking the Census: so David, by one
    account (2 Sam. xxiv. 9) mustered one million three hundred thousand
    ‘valiant men that drew the Sword.’<a id="FNanchor_593" href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a> The expression ‘girding on
    the Sword’ (1 Sam. xxv. 13) denoted adults able to serve as soldiers,
    and also noted the beginning of a campaign (Deut. i. 41). It has been
    stated that Saul, son of Kish, used the Sword with his left hand, by
    virtue of being of the tribe of Benjamin. Of the latter, however, we
    learn (Judg. xx. 16) that many were ambidexters, fighting and slinging
    with the left as well as with the right. Finally, to be ‘slain by the
    Sword’ was evidently as great a misfortune as the ‘straw-death’ among
    those muscular Christians, the Scandinavians. The curse of David upon
    Joab was that there might never be wanting in his house ‘one that hath
    an issue, or is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff, or that falleth on
    the Sword’ (a suicide). All this makes the fact the more singular that
    no Jewish Sword-blade has ever been found.</p>

  <p>Of the weapons used by the tribes neighbouring the ancient Hebrews we
    know little. In the famous muster of Xerxes’ army,<a id="FNanchor_594" href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a> the Assyrians,
    according to Herodotus (vii. 65), used hand-daggers (<span lang="grc">ἐγχειρίδια</span>)
    resembling the Egyptian. The Arabs (vii. 69, 86), like the Indians,
    were mere savages armed with bows and arrows; and we may note that
    the former mounted only camels, the horse not having been naturalised
    amongst all the tribes in the days of the ‘Great King’ (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
    485–465). The Philistine<a id="FNanchor_595" href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a> weapons are known to us only by the
    famous duello between David and Goliath of Gath (1 Sam. xvii.). The
    account is full of difficulties for the ‘reconciler’ of contradictory
    texts; for instance, David is Saul’s <span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>armour-bearer, and yet unknown at
    Court.<a id="FNanchor_596" href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a> Nor is it easy to discover where Gath is. It is popularly
    identified with Kharbat (ruins of) Gat: this heap of ruins lies west of
    castled Bayt Jibrín, the ‘House of Giants’ (tyrants), the Arabic name
    corresponding with the Hebrew Bethogabra. The field of fight has been
    found in the Wady El-Samt (Elah of St. Jerome), west of Jerusalem. The
    people of this part of Palestine, probably descended from the Hyksos
    or Canaanites, are a fine tall race, bred to fray and foray by the
    neighbourhood of predatory Bedawin:<a id="FNanchor_597" href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a> armed to the teeth, they are
    adepts in the use of the huge ‘nebút’ or quarterstaff.</p>

  <p>The plain of Philistia, which once supported five princely cities,
    appears very barren viewed from the sea; but the interior shows
    well-watered valleys, and the succession of ruins proves that the
    country belonged to an energetic and industrious race. Gaza (‘Azzah),
    at the southern extremity, was a place of considerable importance, on
    account of its fine port and its trade with the adjacent Bedawin. It
    must not be confused with modern Ghazzah.<a id="FNanchor_598" href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a></p>

  <p>Goliath, the ‘champion of the uncircumcised’ (Philistines), and
    possibly a type of the race, wore armour<a id="FNanchor_599" href="#Footnote_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a> of ‘brass’ (copper);
    unfortunately the materials of his Sword and sheath are not specified.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>THE CYPRUS SWORD.</i></div>

  <p>Leaving Syria, we proceed to Cyprus, which may be considered an
    outlying part of Palestine. Its size, its position between the east
    and the west, and its wealth in gold, silver, copper, and iron, made
    it an important station for the early Pelasgo-Hellenic or Græco-Italic
    race which passed westwards, using the Hellespont and the Bosphorus for
    ferry-places, and the Ægean Islands for stepping-stones. Thus Cyprus
    became the ‘cradle of Greek culture, the cauldron in which Asiatic,
    Egyptian, and Greek ingredients were brewed together.’ General Palma
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>(di Cesnola)<a id="FNanchor_600" href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a> has proved, by his invaluable finds, which have
    ‘added a new and very important chapter to the history of art and
    archæology,’ that early Cypriote art was essentially Egyptian, modified
    by Phœnician and Assyrian influences, and eventually becoming Greek.
    Hence, too, with the dawn of Hellenic civilisation, migrated westwards
    some of the fairest classical myths. Cyprus was the very birthplace
    of Venus,<a id="FNanchor_601" href="#Footnote_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a> an anthropomorphism which rendered infinite service to
    poetry, painting, and sculpture. Idalium (Dali) was the capital of
    Cinyras, Kinnári the harper,<a id="FNanchor_602" href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a> the Crœsus of his day; it was the
    site of Myrrha’s sin and the death-place of her son Adonis. The latter,
    who corresponds with the Tammuz of Palestine and the Assyrian Du-zi
    (Son of Life), is made by Ammianus Marcellinus (xxii. 14) an ‘emblem
    of the fruits of the earth cut down in their prime.’ Here was the
    <i>atelier</i> of Pygmalion, Fa’am Aliyun (<i>Malleus Deorum</i>), the hammer of
    the gods;<a id="FNanchor_603" href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a> and here upon his breathing statue of ivory he begat
    Paphos, the king. Finally, here flourished the poets who preceded the
    Homerid chief; and here was born Zeno, the Stoic, the ‘Phœnician.’</p>

  <p>The history of Cyprus begins soon after the beginning. An inscription
    of Thut-mes III. speaks of the ‘false breed of the Kittim’; and the
    island is everywhere on the monuments called Asibi. In the cuneiforms
    the word is ‘Kittie’: we also find ‘Atnán’: hence, possibly, the
    Hellenic ‘Akamantis.’ It is the ‘Chittim’ of the Hebrews (Joseph. ‘A.
    J.’ i. 7), and perhaps their ‘Caphtor’; the latter word, however,
    appears to be the Egyptian ‘Kefa’ or ‘Keft’ (a palm or Phœnicia),
    converted into the son of Javan and grandson of Japhet. ‘Kittim’ and
    its congeners survive in the Greek Citium, now Larnaca, from ‘larnax,’
    a mummy-case, a coffin. I have already noticed (chap. iv.) the disputed
    origin of ‘Kypros’ and ‘Cyprus.’</p>

  <p>The Autochthones of Cyprus are supposed upon very slight grounds to
    have been ‘Aryans’ from Asia Minor, Phrygians,<a id="FNanchor_604" href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a> Lycians,<a id="FNanchor_605" href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a>
    Lydians, or Cilicians. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>There must have been an early ‘Semitic’
    innervation, as we see by such names as Amathus; this is the Greek form
    of Hamath, the ‘high town,’ typically explained by the Hebrew ‘Amath,’
    grandson of Canaan. The Phœnicians settled chiefly in the south of the
    island and made it an outpost of Tyre and Sidon. Herodotus tells us
    that there were also, according to their own account, Ethiopians (vii.
    90), by which he means Cushito-Asiatic tribes from the head of the
    Persian Gulf.</p>

  <p>The staple of Cyprus, from the heroic ages to the Roman days, was the
    copper-trade and the manufacture of arms and armour. To the legendary
    Tyrio-Cyprian king Cinyras was attributed the invention of the hammer,
    anvil, tongs, and other metallurgic tools. This favourite of Venus was
    only the <i>hero eponymus</i> of the Phœnician Cinyradæ, who ruled the isle
    till subdued by Ptolemy Lagi (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 312). They were opposed to
    a Semitico-Cilician family of priests and prophets, the Tamyridæ. Homer
    (‘Il.’ xi. 19) describes the breast-plate of worked and damascened
    steel (? <span lang="grc">κύανος</span>) adorned with gold and tin, which King Cinyras sent
    to Agamemnon. Alexander the Great highly prized, for its lightness
    and temper, the blade given to him by the King of Citium; and we know
    that he used it in battle, slaying ‘with his Cyprian Sword’ Rhæsales
    the Persian. Demetrius Poliorcetes wore a suit of armour from Cyprus,
    which had been tested by darts shot from an engine distant only twenty
    paces. In Herodotus (vii. 90) the Cyprian contingent of Xerxes’ army
    was weaponed after the manner of the Greeks.</p>

  <p>Cyprus would derive her art from the Phœnicians, whose bronze dishes
    were found in the Palace-cellars at Nineveh. Gem-engraving, and working
    in <i>pietra dura</i>, were highly cultivated, as is proved by General
    Palma’s works, and by the Lawrence-Cesnola collection, ‘Album of Cyprus
    Antiquities.’<a id="FNanchor_606" href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a> Glass- and crystal-cutting were well known at a time
    when Herodotus (ii. 69) could describe the former only as ‘fusible
    stone’—perhaps, however, alluding to paste gems. But Theophrastus,
    a century and a half after the historian, mentions glass as reported
    to be made by melting a certain stone. I have already alluded to the
    peculiar decency and decorum of the glyptic remains in the Isle of
    Venus, where the festivals were described as being ultra-Canopic in
    character.<a id="FNanchor_607" href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a></p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>CYPRUS WEAPONS.</i></div>

  <p>The ‘finds’ of Cyprian weapons have little importance; perhaps due care
    was not devoted to the subject. Dali (Idalium) produced a fine dagger
    with an open ring for ornament between handle and blade, together
    with a hatchet and spear-head in copper. Here also was found the
    bronze tablet of the Duc de Luynes, the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>discoverer of the Cypriote
    syllabary,<a id="FNanchor_608" href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a> which has caused, and still causes, so much discussion.
    Alambra yielded a number of copper tools, needles, bowls, mirrors,
    hatchets, spear-heads, and daggers (Cesnola, Pl. V.). Among them is a
    sickle-shaped implement (<i>a</i>), of the shape called a ‘razor’ by writers
    on Etruscanism; it may be anything between a razor, a sickle, and a
    pruning-hook.<a id="FNanchor_609" href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a> A tomb at Amathus supplied copper axes and iron
    arrow-heads (p. 280), and another an iron dagger (p. 276). There is
    a charming dagger from the Curium treasure (Pl. XXI. p. 312); and we
    are told (p. 335) of ‘an iron dagger with part of its ivory handle.’
    The straight blade, the flesh-chopper, and the leaf-shaped Egyptian
    Swords are found on a patera<a id="FNanchor_610" href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a> (p. 329), and the broken <span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>statue of
    a warrior from Golgoi carries a falchion or flesh-chopper slung under
    the quiver to the left side (p. 155). The tombs containing horsemen
    in terra-cotta invariably yielded one or two spear-heads seven to ten
    inches long, whilst the figures of foot-soldiers were accompanied by a
    battle-axe, knife, or dagger. The decapitation of the Gorgon by Perseus
    adorns a sarcophagus also found at Golgoi (Pl. X.); and the head of
    Medusa (Pl. XXII.) apparently suggested that of the Hindú Kali, with
    the tongue lolling out as if gorged with gore. The mediæval finds
    of arms seem to have been more important than the ancient. There is
    a tempting notice, but only a notice, of the Venetian weapons taken
    from the two casements of Famagosta, of old Amta-Khadasta,<a id="FNanchor_611" href="#Footnote_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a> the
    Ammochostos of Ptolemy (v. 14, § 3): especially interesting are the
    rapiers, whose handles bore the Jerusalem Cross and the owners’ crests
    inlaid with gold.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>TROJAN WEAPONS.</i></div>

  <p>On the mainland north of Cyprus lies a most remarkable land which,
    forming a point of junction, a connecting-link between the East and
    the West, was one of the tracks of primitive emigration from Asia
    to Europe, and <i>vice versâ</i>. This <i lang="fr">tête de pont</i>, commanding the
    island-bridge and the various stepping-stones of rock, is the famous
    Troas, occupied of old by a branch of the great Phrygian race. Hence
    the interest attaching to the excavations of Dr. Henry Schliemann. His
    works are too well known to require any detailed notice of the five
    (seven?) cities ‘whose successive layers of ruins, still marked by the
    fires that passed over them, are piled to the height of fifty (two
    and a half) feet above the old summit of the Hisárlik hill.’<a id="FNanchor_612" href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a> The
    explorer’s labours, according to his editor, have passed through the
    ‘several stages of uncritical acceptance, hypercritical rejection, and
    discriminating belief’: I can only remark that the question of Troy
    appears farther from being settled (if possible) than it ever was; we
    now know only where it was not. The excavator began by placing his city
    of Priam in the second stratum from below, at a depth of twenty-three
    to thirty-three feet under the surface; and afterwards raised it to the
    third layer. It is regretable that the learned author did not submit
    his lively volume ‘Troy’ to a professed archæologist. We should not
    have heard so much about the Svasti, a Hittite ornament, nor should we
    have been told that the Trojans used ‘salt-cellars or pepper-boxes’ (p.
    79); that the Ramayana Epic was ‘composed at the latest eight hundred
    years before Christ’ (p. 103), and that the ‘ivory, peacocks, and
    apes are <i>Sanskrit</i> words with scarcely any <span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>alteration.’<a id="FNanchor_613" href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a> When,
    therefore, I speak of ‘Troy proper,’ and ‘Trojan stratum,’ I mean only
    Dr. Schliemann’s Troy.</p>

  <p>The townlet had preserved, at the time of its destruction, the
    technological use of stone, which, indeed, was found in the four lower
    strata, and even in the Acropolis of Athens. It occurs, however, in
    conjunction with gold and silver, copper, bronze, and traces of iron,
    but no tin.<a id="FNanchor_614" href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a> The people were, like most barbarians, very expert
    metallurgists; and if Dr. Schliemann’s diorite be true diorite,<a id="FNanchor_615" href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a>
    they must have worked with highly-tempered tools. Copper, either pure
    or slightly alloyed, was the most common metal: we read of a key, a
    large double-edged axe, a vase-foot, nails, clothes-pins (<span lang="grc">ἔμβολα</span>), a
    curious instrument like a horse’s bit (p. 261); a bar, a big ring, a
    chauldron (<span lang="grc">λέβης</span>), a ridge (<span lang="grc">φάλος</span>) for the helmet-crest (<span lang="grc">λόφος</span>), two
    whole helmets, three crooked knives, and a lance with a mid-rib (p.
    279). Upon the so-called ‘great Tower of Ilios’<a id="FNanchor_616" href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a> was found a large
    mould of mica-schist for casting twelve different articles, axes and
    daggers. Thus we learn something about the long copper knives which
    the Homeric heroes carry besides their Swords and use in sacrifice:
    also we may now reasonably conclude that the Iliad-poets could not,
    as has often been asserted, have ignored the fusion and the casting
    of metals.<a id="FNanchor_617" href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a> Near this important mould appeared a fine lance (p.
    279), and long thin bars, either with heads or with the ends bent
    round, determined to be hair- or breast-pins. Iron showed only in a
    sling-bullet, although Dr. Schliemann often mentions ‘loadstone.’<a id="FNanchor_618" href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a></p>

  <p>The ‘upper Trojan stratum’ yielded other moulds for bar-casting and a
    four-footed crucible, in which some copper was still visible. The gates
    supposed to be the Scæan or left-handed<a id="FNanchor_619" href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a> had two copper bolts (p.
    302). The so-called ‘Palace <span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>of Priam’<a id="FNanchor_620" href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a> produced a dozen long thin
    pins for hair or dress; and one of a bundle of five, fused together by
    fire, had two separate heads, the upper lentil-shaped, and the lower
    perfectly round (p. 312). Thick nails, fitted for driving into wood,
    were rare; the labour of two years produced only two. Finally, there
    were fragments of a Sword, a lance, and other instruments.</p>

    <div class="caption smcap">Fig. 200.—Copper Sword with Sharp end, from the ‘Treasury of Priam.’</div>
  </div>

  <p>The first article found in the so-called ‘Treasury of Priam’ was a
    copper shield (<span lang="grc">ἀσπὶς ὀμφαλόεσσα</span>), an oval salver measuring in diameter
    less than twenty inches. The flat field is surrounded by a rim (<span lang="grc">ἄντυξ</span>)
    an inch and a half high; the umbo (<span lang="grc">ὀμφαλός</span>)<a id="FNanchor_621" href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a> measured two and
    one-third by four and one-third across, and this boss was bounded
    by a furrow (<span lang="grc">αὖλαξ</span>) two-fifths of an inch across (p. 324). Thus
    Antyx and Aulax, suited for mounting a guard of hide, recall Ajax’s
    seven-fold shield, made by Tychius<a id="FNanchor_622" href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a> (‘Il.’ vii. 219–223); and
    Sarpedon’s targe, with its round plate of hammered ‘Chalcos,’ and its
    hide-covering attached to the inner edge of the rim by gold wires or
    rivets (‘Il.’ xii. 294–97). Near the left hand of a Lebes-chauldron,
    two fragments of a lance and a battle-axe were firmly attached by
    fusion. There were thirteen copper lances, from nearly seven inches
    to upwards of a foot long, with one and a half to two and one-third
    inches of maximum breadth; the shafts had pin-holes for attachment
    to the handle; the Greeks and Romans inserted the wood into the neck
    of the metal-head of the lance. There was a common one-edged knife
    six inches long; and of seven two-edged daggers, the largest measured
    ten and two-thirds by two inches. The grips averaged two to two and
    three-quarter inches, and the tang-ends, where the pommels should be,
    were bent round at a right angle. Doubtless the tang had been encased
    in a wooden haft; had it been of bone some trace would have remained,
    and the point, which projected about half an inch, was simply turned
    to keep the handle in place. This antiquated <span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>contrivance is not yet
    wholly obsolete, especially when the metal is left naked. The only
    sign of a Sword (p. 332) was a fragmentary blade five inches and
    two-thirds long by nearly two inches broad, and with a sharp edge
    at the chisel-like end. Many golden buttons, not unlike our modern
    shirt-studs, were found in the ‘Treasury’; they had probably served
    to ornament the belts or straps (<span lang="grc">τελαμῶνες</span>) of knives, shields, and
    Swords.<a id="FNanchor_623" href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a></p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>ALL THE TROYS.</i></div>

  <p>We gather from Dr. Schliemann’s labours that his ‘Troy,’ at the time
    of its destruction, was a townlet still in the local Stone-age; at
    the height of the Copper-Bronze Period; and, perhaps, in the earliest
    dawn of the Iron-epoch. Apparently it had an alphabet, of which the
    Grecian enemy could not boast;<a id="FNanchor_624" href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a> and, comparing its remains with
    those of Mycenæ, its culture fully equalled, if not excelled, that
    of contemporary Hellas. It is curious to observe that the deeper
    the diggings, from twenty-four feet downwards, the greater were the
    indications of technological skill. According to Herodotus (ii. 118),
    the Egyptians bore witness to the power of Troy,<a id="FNanchor_625" href="#Footnote_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a> yet there is an
    utter absence of Nilotic influence in the remains, and Brugsch denies
    that there is any allusion to it on the monuments of Egypt. A similar
    disconnection with Phœnicia and Assyria appears. The resemblance of the
    terra cottas to those found in Cyprus and in some of the Ægean islands
    suggests that there was an early relationship between the Phrygian
    Trojans and the Phrygian Greeks, both being ‘Indo-Europeans’;<a id="FNanchor_626" href="#Footnote_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a> and
    that the eternal Trojan war was, like the later contest between Russia
    and Poland, Federals and Confederates, nothing but a family feud, a
    venomous quarrel of rival cousins.</p>

  <p>To conclude the ever-interesting subject of Troy. Homer, or the
    Homerid so called, describes the city according to current legends,
    as an untravelled Englishman of to-day would describe the Calais
    of Queen Mary. There is no reason to believe that he saw it, much
    less that he painted like the photographing of Balzac. Hence it is
    a daring more than sublime, to find the Scæan Gate and the Palace
    of Priam. Even the number of superimposed settlements differs.
    Dr. Schliemann (‘Ilios,’ &amp;c.) proposes seven, while Dr. Wilhelm
    Dörpfeld<a id="FNanchor_627" href="#Footnote_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a> reduces the number to six. These, according to Professor
    Jebb, are as follows: (1) The Greek Ilium of the latest or Roman age,
    extending to about six feet below the surface. (2) The Greek Ilium of
    Macedonian age taken by Fimbria in <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 85; it extends over
    the plateau adjoining Hisárlik. (3) A Greek Ilium of earlier age,
    taken by Charidemus (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 359); it appears confined to the
    little mound. (4) <span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>Another unimportant village; possibly No. 3 in its
    earliest form, when the Æolic settlers occupied Hisárlik: the evidence
    of the pottery<a id="FNanchor_628" href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a> suggests these to have been the oldest Hellenic
    remains. (5) Prehistoric city; and (6) a distinct stratum of ruins also
    prehistoric. To these Dr. Schliemann adds (7) the earliest prehistoric
    buildings founded on the floor-rock fifty-two feet below the surface
    and fifty-nine above the present level of the plain.</p>

  <p>Finally, Mr. W. W. Goodwin<a id="FNanchor_629" href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a> comes to the ‘ultimate conclusion’
    about Hisárlik, that it shows only two important settlements. The first
    is the large prehistoric city extending over the hill and plateau. The
    second is the historic Ilium in its three phases of primitive Æolic
    occupation of the Acropolis, the Macedonian city, and the Roman Ilium.</p>

  <p>The immediate neighbours of Troy were the Lydians, whom history makes
    the forefathers of the ancient Etruscans.<a id="FNanchor_630" href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a> Herodotus (i. 94) tells
    the tale of Tyrrhenus and his emigration, which, however, differs from
    the account of Xanthus Lydius preserved by Nicolaus of Damascus. In
    the ‘Iliad’ (ii. 864), the Lydians appear only as Mæonians. They were
    a people of Iranian speech, to judge from such words as <span lang="grc">καν</span> (<i>canis</i>,
    <i>kyon</i>, <i>svan</i>, &amp;c., a dog), and ‘Sardis’ from ‘Sarat’ or ‘Sard,’ in
    old Persian Thrade and in modern Persian Sál = a year. Apparently their
    language had affinities with the Etruscan and Latin; for instance,
    Myrsilus, son of Myrsus, the Græco-Lydian name of Candaules (Herod. i.
    7), has been compared with Larthial-i-sa; and Servilius from Servius,
    the <i>l</i> denoting son (<i>filius</i>), shows the same peculiarity. The
    Lydians were a civilised people who first coined gold (Herod. i. 94)
    and stamped silver (<i>ibid.</i>);<a id="FNanchor_631" href="#Footnote_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a> their name will ever be connected
    with music. With them twelve was a sacred number; it formed the perfect
    Amphictyony of the Ionians, and it survived in the Confederacy of
    Etruscan cities (Livy, v. 33). Finally, the tomb of Alyattes<a id="FNanchor_632" href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a> is
    apparently a prototype of the Etruscan sepulchres; and the peculiarity
    of these ‘homes of the dead’ suggests direct derivation from Egypt
    rather than coincidental resemblance.</p>

  <p>Until late years it has been accepted as an historic fact that the
    old colonisers of Tyrrhenia dwelt for years as conquerors in Lower
    Egypt. The Tuisa, Tursha, Toersha, and Turisa of the monuments wear
    a close-fitting <i>calotte</i> with a tall point, whence a long thin
    tassel falls to the back of the neck, like one of the Cyprus caps and
    the older style of Moslem Fez.<a id="FNanchor_633" href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a> But Brugsch<a id="FNanchor_634" href="#Footnote_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a> converts the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>monumental Tursha into Taurians: he wholly discredits the existence of
    a Pelasgo-Italic confederacy in the days of Mene-Ptah I. and of Ramses
    III.; and he positively asserts that the Egyptians of the Fourteenth
    Dynasty knew nothing of Ilium and the Dardanians, Mysians and Lycians,
    Lydians and Etruscans, Sardinians, Greek Achæans,<a id="FNanchor_635" href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a> Siculians,
    Teucinians, and Oscans.</p>

  </div>

  <p>However that may be, the Etruscans, the <i>acerrimi Tusci</i> of Virgil,
    were a people of high culture, to whose inventive and progressive
    genius Rome owed her early steps in arts and arms.<a id="FNanchor_636" href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a> A flood of
    light has been thrown upon this page of proto-historic lore by the
    extensive excavations of late years in the Emilian country about
    Bologna, the Felsina or Velsina of Tyrrhenia. My late friend, the
    learned and lamented Prof. G. G. Bianconi, forwarded to me the
    accompanying sketch (fig. 202) of an exceptional iron blade found in
    the ruins of Marzabotto.<a id="FNanchor_637" href="#Footnote_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a> It is described as follows (p. 3) in a
    work, printed but not published, by the learned archæologist Count
    Gozzadini of Bologna, ‘Di ulteriori scoperte nell’ antica necropoli di
    Marzabotto nel Bolognese’<a id="FNanchor_638" href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a>:—</p>

  <p>‘Within a cell only thirty centimètres deep, and disposed two mètres
    distant from one another, lay three skeletons whose heads fronted
    eastwards. On each was an iron Sword-blade, sixty-two centimètres long
    by four and a half broad near the tang (<i>spina</i>), and fining off to an
    olive-leaf point; all have the mid-rib or longitudinal spine. Partly
    attached by oxidation to one blade is a remnant of the iron scabbard,
    slightly convex posteriorly and showing in the upper part a rectangular
    projection, perhaps to carry the hook attached to the balteus. The
    sheath-front has a mid-rib like the blade, and the wavy mouth is
    adapted to the Sword-shoulders. On this face only are two buttons
    (<i>borchie</i>) in high relief, connected by a band (<i>listello</i>). The tang,
    twelve centimètres long, shows the length of the hilt, which, being
    made of more perishable material, has altogether disappeared.’</p>

  <p>The long narrow rapier-blade with the mid-rib is first seen in the
    Egyptian bronzes;<a id="FNanchor_639" href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a> the step was easy to the harder metal. That the
    iron form was common in Etruria as its bronze congener at Mycenæ, is
    proved by the discovery of three in a single tomb; moreover, as has
    been said, a fourth has been preserved for years in the Marzabotto
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>collection. All are similar in form, which is highly civilised. The
    number of the blades also suggests that they are of native make, not
    left by the Boians and the Ligaunians, who, according to the late Prof.
    Conestabile, may have buried in the Marzabotto cemetery. The date of
    the latter is somewhat uncertain; but it cannot be much more recent
    than the burial-ground of Villanova, where Count Gozzadini found an <i>æs
    rude</i>, and which he dates from the days of Numa, <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 700.
    He is followed by Dr. Schliemann (‘Troy,’ p. 40), and opposed by that
    learned and practical anthropologist M. Gabrielle de Mortillet (‘Le
    Signe de la Croix,’ &amp;c. pp. 88–89), who would assign a far earlier
    epoch.</p>

  <p>Count Gozzadini<a id="FNanchor_640" href="#Footnote_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a> gives a valuable description of a fifth Etruscan
    Sword lately discovered at the ‘Palazzino’ farm, parish of Ceretolo and
    commune of Casalecchio, some ten kilomètres south-west of ‘Etruscan
    Bologna.’ In an isolated tomb, carefully excavated by the proprietor
    (Marchese Tommaso Boschi), was found a skeleton, the feet fronting
    southwards. On its left, extending higher than the head, was an iron
    lance-point,<a id="FNanchor_641" href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a> and on the corresponding shoulder a thick armilla of
    bronze; other objects, including an Etruscan Œnochoe, two knives wholly
    iron, and a chisel of the same metal, lay scattered about the grave
    which was not stone-revetted. Close to the right side was an iron Sword
    in a sheath of the same metal and wanting the heft: the general belief
    was that the weapon had been buried with the wielder.</p>

  <p>Count Gozzadini (pp. 19, 20) describes the Sword as follows: ‘Slightly
    bi-convex and two-edged, it measures 0·625 mètre from the tang
    (<i>codolo</i>) to the end of the scabbard; the tang, not including the
    part forming the grip, was 0·11 mètre. The breadth is 0·47 mètre at
    the shoulders, narrowing to a point, as is proved by the scabbard
    diminishing to 0·27 mètre at the end. The handle showed no sign of
    cross-bars or guard, which would also have been of iron; and it is
    evident that the haft was of some destructible substance which has
    wholly disappeared. The probability is that the grip was shaped like
    those of the preceding Bronze Age—that is, bulging out behind the
    blade for easier hold. The sheath was somewhat more bi-convex than
    the Sword; an iron-plate about one millimètre thick, had been turned
    over horizontally to unite the edges, which, near one of the sides,
    formed a narrow and gradual line of superposition. This scabbard ended
    in an ovoid crampet or ferule; and a fragment of plate iron with a
    short broad hook, like that generally used for attachment to the belt,
    probably belonged to it.’</p>

  <p>Here, then, we have again a perfect rapier. The only question is
    whether it was Etruscan, or, as supposed by M. G. de Mortillet,
    Gaulish.<a id="FNanchor_642" href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a> Count Gozzadini argues ably to prove the former
    case.<a id="FNanchor_643" href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a> He acknowledges that the invading Boii <span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>held the city and
    country for two centuries (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 358–566), until the Romans
    expelled them for ever. But he shows that these peoples did not use
    such fine Swords. When treating of the Kelts (<a href="#CHAPTER_VIII" title="Go to chapter 8">chapter xiii</a>.), I
    shall show that the long unmanageable slashing Claidab or Spatha of
    these peoples had nothing in common with the strong, bi-convex, and
    thoroughly-civilised rapier of Ceretolo.</p>

  <p>Other blades like that of Ceretolo—long, narrow, and pointed—have
    been found in tombs notably Etruscan. Such, for instance, was that of
    Cære, now in the Gregorian Museum, Rome. In December 1879 two other
    blades were produced by a necropolis in Valdichiana, between Chiusi
    and Arezzo, where a long Etruscan inscription was engraved upon the
    foot of a tazza. Two similar blades are also portrayed in relief
    and colour upon the stuccoed wall of a Cære tomb. Des Vergers<a id="FNanchor_644" href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a>
    describes them as follows: ‘La frise supérieure est ornée d’Épées
    longues à deux tranchants, à la lame large et droite avec garde à la
    poignée, se rapprochant de celle que les Romains désignaient par le nom
    de <i>spatha</i>. Les unes sont nues, les autres dans le fourreau.’ Four
    such Swords were also produced at Pietrabbondante in the district of
    far-famed Isernia, and are preserved in the National Museum of Naples.
    Signor Campanari discovered in an Etruscan tomb a Sword-hilt in bronze
    attached to a blade of iron.<a id="FNanchor_645" href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a> Finally, the Benacci property near
    the Certosa of Bologna also yielded an iron blade and iron chisels like
    those of Ceretolo.</p>

  <p>The late learned Prof. Conestabile truly asserts, ‘Des Épées de même
    forme et de même dimension ont été trouvées dans d’autres localités
    étrusques, situées dehors la sphère des invasions Gauloises, notamment
    en Toscane.’ It is certain that such blades have been discovered on
    both sides of the Alps. As the Romans adopted the Iberic or Spanish
    blade; so the Gauls may have substituted for their own imperfect arms
    the weapons taken from the Italians; in fact, we know from history
    that they did so. Moreover, the Etruscans extended their commerce, not
    only over Transalpine regions, but to that vast region extending from
    Switzerland to Denmark, and from Wallachia to England and Ireland.<a id="FNanchor_646" href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a>
    This has been proved by the investigations of many scholars: in
    Germany by Lindenschmidt, Von Sacken, Virchow, Kenner, Weihold, Von
    Conhausen, and Genthe; by the Swiss Morlot, De Rougemont, Desor, and
    De Bonstetten; by the Dane Worsäae; by Gray, Dennis, Hamilton, and
    Wyllie in England; by the Belgian Schuermans; and by the Italians
    Gozzadini, Conestabile, Garrucci, and Gamurrini. Desor, when receiving
    the drawing of an iron Sword with bronze handle discovered at Sion, and
    declared by Thioly to resemble exactly those of Hallstadt, declared:
    ‘De pareilles Épées sont évidemment fabriquées à l’étranger et non dans

    qui se faisait pendant la <span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>première époque de fer, époque sur laquelle
    on s’est trompé si souvent.’ Livy,<a id="FNanchor_647" href="#Footnote_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a> in fact, proves the extent of
    arms-manufactory in Etruria, when he relates that in <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 205,
    at which time the Boiian occupation of Felsina ended, Arezzo alone
    could furnish Scipio’s fleet in forty-five days with three thousand
    helmets, as many Scuta and lances of three different kinds.</p>

  <p>But the rapier was not the only form of Etruscan Sword. In Hamilton’s
    ‘Etruscan Antiquities,’<a id="FNanchor_648" href="#Footnote_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a> a human figure carries a cutting Sword
    like a ‘hanger,’ wearing the belt at the bottom of the thorax. The
    Céramique of Etruria supplies copious illustrations of Swords and other
    weapons; but the art is somewhat mixed, and our safest information must
    be derived from actual finds.</p>

  <p>We are justified by these finds in concluding that the Etruscans
    of Italy had from their earliest times a rapier which, for a
    cut-and-thrust weapon, is well-nigh perfect. The blade is long, but
    not too long; broad enough to be efficient without overweight, and
    strengthened to the utmost by the mid-rib which forms a shallow arch.
    In <a href="#CHAPTER_XI" title="Go to chapter 11">chapter xi</a>. I shall compare the Etrurian Sword with that of Mycenæ;
    the latter is a marvel of its kind, but it is made of a far inferior
    metal—bronze.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Although</span> Professor Lepsius maintained and proved that the earliest
    Babylonian civilisation was imported from Egypt, Biblical leanings,
    and the fatal practice of reading myths and mysteries as literal
    history, have led many moderns to hold the Plain of Shinar (Babylon)
    and the ancient head of the Persian Gulf to be the cradle of culture
    and the origin of ‘Semitism.’ We still read, ‘Babylonia stands
    prominent as highly civilised and densely populated at a period
    when Egypt was still in her youthful prime.’<a id="FNanchor_649" href="#Footnote_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a> Only in Genesis
    (x. 10), a document treating of later ethnology, we find mention of
    Erech,<a id="FNanchor_650" href="#Footnote_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a> Urukh being the oldest traditional king of Babylon. On
    the other hand, the Egyptians declared Belus and his subjects to have
    been an Egyptian colony which taught the rude Babylonians astrology
    and other arts. The monumental Babylonian or pre-Chaldæan Empire
    begins only in <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 2300, many a century—say a score—after
    Menes. The late Mr. George Smith warns us that some scholars would
    make the annals ‘stretch nearly two thousand years beyond that time’;
    but he expressly declares no approximate date can be fixed for any
    king before Kara-Indas (circ. <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 1475?–1450?). Also, ‘The
    great temples of Babylonia were founded by the kings who preceded the
    conquest by Hammu-rabi, King of the Kassi’ Arabs (sixteenth century
    <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>).<a id="FNanchor_651" href="#Footnote_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span></p>

  <p>The Burbur or Accad inscriptions found in Babylonia do not date
    before <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 2000. Ninus, the builder of Nineveh (Fish-town)
    and the founder of the Assyrian dynasties, is usually placed between
    <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 2317 and 2116. An extract, by Alexander Polyhistor
    from the Armenian<a id="FNanchor_652" href="#Footnote_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a> Chronicle, gives, by adding the dynasties, an
    origin-date of 2,317 years. Berosus the priest, declares from official
    documents, that Babylon (God’s Gate) had regal annals 1,000 years
    before Solomon (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 993–953), in whose reign dynastic Jewish
    history begins. Diodorus Siculus, quoting Ctesias (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 395)
    makes the monarchy commence one thousand years before the Siege of
    Troy, which we may place about <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 1200. Æmilius Sura, quoted
    by Paterculus, proposes the date <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 2145, and Eusebius the
    Armenian 1340 years before the first Olympiad (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 776), or
    <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 2116. The great kingdom of the Khita (Hittites)<a id="FNanchor_653" href="#Footnote_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a>
    was succeeded on the rich lowlands of the Tigris-Euphrates system by
    Babylon, which the Nilotes called ‘Har,’ and by the Assyrians, whom the
    Egyptians called Mat or the People, and hieroglyphs notice the ‘Great
    King of the Mat.’ But <img class="iglyph-2" src="images/i_200_s.png" alt="" width="37" height="20" />
    Assur<a id="FNanchor_654" href="#Footnote_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a> was little known till
    the decline of the Pharaohs in the Twenty-first Dynasty (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
    1100–966) of the priest Hirhor and his successors: one of the
    latter—Ramessu or Ramses XVI.—married, when dethroned, a daughter
    of Pallasharnes, the ‘great king of the Assyrians,’ whose capital was
    Nineveh,<a id="FNanchor_655" href="#Footnote_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a> and thus led to the Assyrian invasions of Egypt.<a id="FNanchor_656" href="#Footnote_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a> We
    may, then, safely hold with Lepsius that early Babylonian civilisation
    was posterior to, if not imported from, Egypt.<a id="FNanchor_657" href="#Footnote_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a></p>

  <p>In Babylonia a third element, the so-called ‘Turanian’ (Chinese),
    first emerged from Egyptian and began to take its part in the drama
    of progress. The almost unknown quantity has assumed magnificent
    proportions in the eyes of certain students, and great things are still
    expected from Akkadian revelation. Yet the race typified by the Chinese
    could have had no effect upon the learning of Egypt. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>‘At the time
    when the genealogical tables of Genesis were written (chap. x.) those
    regions were still so unknown and barbarous that the writer excluded
    them from the civilised world.’<a id="FNanchor_658" href="#Footnote_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a></p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>THE SWORD IN ASSYRIA.</i></div>

  <p>Our factual knowledge of Mesopotamian civilisation is mostly due to
    the labours of the present century. Professor Grotefend of Bonn, in
    1801–1803, discovered the clue to the Persian cuneiform,<a id="FNanchor_659" href="#Footnote_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a> cuneatic
    or arrow-headed character. This great step in advance opened the
    labyrinth to a host of minor explorers—Heeren (1815), Burnouf (1836),
    Lassen (1836–44), Hincks, who attacked the Assyrian cuneiform, and,
    to mention no more, Rawlinson, whose ‘Reading made Easy’ popularised
    the study in England. Actual exploration of the Mesopotamian ruins was
    begun by the learned Consul Botta (Dec. 1842) who, after failing at
    Koyunjik opposite Mosul, worked successfully at Khorsabad, some ten
    miles to the north-east: four years afterwards (Dec. 1846) the first
    collection of Assyrian antiquities reached the Louvre. He was followed
    (Nov. 8, 1845) by Mr. (now Sir) H. A. Layard, who unfortunately was not
    an Orientalist: his various discoveries of a stamped-clay literature,
    and his popular publications, introduced to the public Koyunjik and
    Kal’at Ninawi (Nineveh), Hillah (Babylon), Warká, Sippara (Abu Nabbah)
    sixteen miles south-west of Baghdad, and a variety of Biblical sites.</p>

  <p>This ‘recovery’ of antiquities buried twenty centuries ago, and a whole
    literature of bas-reliefs, enables us to compare the Nile Valley, the
    cradle and mother-country of science and art, with its rival-successor
    on the Tigris-Euphrates. The original workmanship of Assyria, like that
    of Egypt, is still unknown; and, though she borrowed from Nile-land,
    her art is rather a decadence than a rise. The difference, indeed, is
    between the porphyries, the granites, and the syenites of Egypt, and
    the mud-bricks, the coarse black marbles, the rough basalts, and the
    undurable alabasters (a calcareous carbonate) of Interamnian Assyria.
    But the industrious valley-men made the best of their poor material.
    The ruins show the true Egyptian arch; the so-called Ionic capital, the
    original volutes being goats’ horns;<a id="FNanchor_660" href="#Footnote_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a> the Caryatides and Atlantes,
    or human figures acting columns; the cornice, corbel, and bracket;
    with a host of architectural embellishments to fill up plain fields.
    Apparently all migrated from Nile-land. Such were the winged circle,
    the lotus,<a id="FNanchor_661" href="#Footnote_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a> the fir-cone, and the rosette: the latter, also found
    by Dr. Schliemann at ‘Troy’ <span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>(p. 160), became the <i lang="la">rosa mystica</i> of
    Byzantine art, and was used by Christians to denote their origin.
    Again, we have the key-pattern, which is Trojan and Chinese as well
    as Greek; the honeysuckle, a symbol of the Homa or Assyrian ‘Tree of
    Life’;<a id="FNanchor_662" href="#Footnote_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a> the guilloche-scroll or wave-pattern; and the meander,
    also miscalled the Tuscan border: the latter is common in Egypt and
    Cyprus, and possibly derives from the Hittite Svasti, erroneously
    called Svastika.<a id="FNanchor_663" href="#Footnote_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a> Assyria equally excelled in literature,<a id="FNanchor_664" href="#Footnote_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a> in
    painting, in sculpture, in the minor arts, and in metallurgy. She made
    transparent glass: a crystal lens<a id="FNanchor_665" href="#Footnote_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a> found at Nineveh accounts for
    the diminutive size of some inscriptions. Her sons worked enamel, and
    thus adorned the humble brick: like their Egyptian teachers, they were
    skilful in ivory-carving, in cutting cylinders of jasper and <i>pietra
    dura</i>, and in gem-engraving on carnelian, onyx, sardonyx, amethyst,
    agate, chalcedony, and lapis lazuli.</p>

  <p>As regards Assyrian metallurgy, few articles of iron have been
    found in the river-valley’s damp and nitrous soil, but the metal is
    denoted, as in Egypt, by a blue tint, and the god Ninib is termed
    the ‘lord of the iron coat.’ Gold and silver were profusely used as
    ornaments. Lead was dug in the Montes Gordæi (Kurd Mountains) near
    Mosul, the original Ararat of ‘Noah’s ark.’ Copper vessels, bright as
    gold when polished, were found in the palaces of Nimrúd: the ore was
    brought from the northern highlands heading the Tigris Valley, where
    the Arghana ma’adan (Diyar-i-Bekr mine) long supplied the Ottoman
    Empire. The place that exported their tin is disputed.<a id="FNanchor_666" href="#Footnote_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a> They
    worked well in bronze: of this alloy many castings have been found:
    utensils, as pots and cauldrons, cups, forks and spoons, dishes,
    and plates, plain and ornamented; tools, as picks, nails, and saws;
    thin plates; the so-called razors;<a id="FNanchor_667" href="#Footnote_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a> lamps; weapons; an ægis-like
    object also found in Egypt; lance-heads, shields, and door-sockets
    each weighing six pounds and three and three-quarter ounces.<a id="FNanchor_668" href="#Footnote_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a>
    The bronze gates of Balawat, with plates eight feet long showing the
    triumphs of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>Shalmaneser II. (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 884–850), attest high art.
    Layard supplied the British Museum with many iron articles from the
    north-western palace at Nimrúd, and some had iron cores round which
    bronze had been cast for economy. Amongst them were iron chain-armour,
    two rusty helmets ornamented with bronze; picks, hammers, knives, and
    saws.<a id="FNanchor_669" href="#Footnote_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a> The approximate date may be assumed at <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 880.</p>

  <p>In mimic war (hunting) the Assyrians were proficients. Many hundreds
    of bas-reliefs, which are more natural because less conventional
    than those of Egypt, illustrate the chase of the lion, stag, and
    jungle-swine; the wild horse, ass, and bull. They were equally skilled
    in the art of war, which is shown in all its phases, the march, the
    passage of streams, the siege, the battle, the sea-fight, or rather
    the river-fight, the pursuit, and the punishment of prisoners by
    torturing, impaling, flaying alive, crucifixion, and ‘tree-planting’
    or vivi-interment. The abominable cruelties of these Asiatics, still
    practised by the Persian, the Kurd, and the ‘unspeakable’ Turk,
    contrast strongly with the mildness of the African Egyptians. Their
    walls, single or double, were provided with the fosse and the rampart,
    and with machicolations, crenelles, and battlements; the last two
    originally shields like the Egyptian cartouche. The <i lang="fr">places fortes</i>
    were attacked by the wheeled tower,<a id="FNanchor_670" href="#Footnote_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a> the iron-pointed battering
    ram, the scaling ladder, and the pavoise, or large shield common
    throughout Europe in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.<a id="FNanchor_671" href="#Footnote_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a> In
    the field pennons are attached to the lances, and the standard-bearers
    carry eagles. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>The action begins with missiles, slings, darts, and
    arrows; the mace and spear then play their part, and the Sword is
    never absent. The warriors—who appear on foot or horseback, with
    gorgeous caparisons, in chariots or swimming with floats of inflated
    skins—wear helmets of many shapes, crested, crescented, capped with
    the <i>fleur-de-lys</i> and perfectly plain; some are close-fitting with
    ear-flaps, the common skull-cap (<i>namms</i>) of Ancient Egypt, and the
    Indian Kan-top. The head-gear usually ended in a metal point—the
    <i>pickelhaube</i>. The sculptors show imbricated armour or hauberks
    (mail-coats) of the Norman type, with stockings of iron- (?) rings,
    gaiters, and boots laced up in front. The shields, either circular or
    rounded at the top and straight at the bottom, cover the whole body.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>THE ASSYRIAN SWORD.</i></div>

  <p>The Assyrian Sword, like the Egyptian, is of four principal shapes.
    One, a long poniard of Nilotic form, is carried by all classes from
    king to slinger. The other (<i>Malmulla</i>, ? fig. 206, 3), by some
    translated ‘falchion,’ appears slightly curved, not like the Turkish
    scymitar, but with the half-bend of the Japanese and the Indian
    Talwár. The curved blades in the bas-reliefs mostly characterise
    conquered peoples. The third is the Sa-pa-ra or Khopsh, of which an
    illustration will be given (p. 208); and the fourth is a club-shaped
    blade thickening at the end, which is almost pointless.<a id="FNanchor_672" href="#Footnote_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a> In the
    cuneiforms a ‘double Sword’ is often mentioned: it may be of the kind
    called by the Greeks ‘Chelidonian’ (chap. ix. and xi.).<a id="FNanchor_673" href="#Footnote_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a> Fancy
    weapons appear in the bas-reliefs—for instance, the Sword from the

  <p>Mostly the weapons have richly decorated hilts and scabbards. In a
    royal <span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>sculpture the pommel is formed by a mound or hemisphere—a
    constant ornament—and below it is a ball between two flat discs: the
    upper jaws of two lions, placed opposite each other, embrace the blade
    and the grip where it presses against the metal sheath-mouth. Another
    has a lion’s head on the handle. The two-lion scabbard is common, and
    sometimes the beasts are locked in a death embrace. In another specimen
    the royal blade is much broader than usual, and two lions couchant form
    the ferrule, embracing the sheath with their paws and retrogardant or
    bending their heads backwards (fig. 212). The ferrule of another is
    enriched with a guilloche. In the inscriptions of Assur-bani-pal<a id="FNanchor_674" href="#Footnote_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a>
    (Sardanapalus) we read of a ‘steel Sword and its sheath of gold,’ and
    of ‘steel Swords of their girdles.’ Another legend runs—‘He lifted his
    great Sword called “Lord of the Storm,”’ proving that the Sword, like
    the horse, the chariot, the boat, and other favourites, had names and
    titles.</p>

    cross-belts. The Sword is always worn on the left side.<a id="FNanchor_676" href="#Footnote_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a> A royal
    Sword-belt bears several ranges of bosses and globules, which may be
    pearls: that of the eunuch-attendant has three wide rows, the central
    broken here and there by round plates. A Magian wears a broad scarf
    with long hanging fringes cast obliquely over the left shoulder: it is
    edged with a triple series of small rosettes placed in squares, and it
    passes over the Sword, to which, perhaps, it acts bauldric. A soldier’s
    bauldric is coloured red, like the wood of the bows and arrows. Another
    eunuch wears the Sword-belt buckled over the waist-sash, and holds in
    his right hand a scourge: this was the emblem of official rank, as the

  <div class="sidenote"><i>THE SWORD IN ASSYRIA.</i></div>

  <p>The Sword and the Sword-dagger seem to have been universally used
    in Assyria—none but captives and working men are without them. The
    vulture-headed ‘Nisroch the god’ (of Nebuchadnezzar) carries two long
    poniards in his breast garment, whereas Ashur in statues shoots his
    bow. Assur-bani-pal ‘destroys the people of Arabia with his Sword.’
    The king in his car, with his Cidaris (tiara) and fly-flap, has two
    daggers and a Sword in his girdle, from which hang cords and tassels.
    Another rests his right hand upon a staff, and his left upon the
    pommel of his weapon. A third plunges a short straight blade, like the
    matador’s <i>espada</i>, between the second and third vertebræ of a wild
    bull, where the spinal cord is most assailable: this would be done
    to-day in the spectacula of Spain. Swords are worn by the magi and the
    eunuchs;<a id="FNanchor_678" href="#Footnote_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a> and one of the latter draws his weapon to cut off a head.
    The body-guard bears by his side a Sword longer than usual, and holds
    arrows and other weapons for his lord’s use. Even the executioner does
    his work with the Sword.</p>

  <p>Happily for students, an ancient Assyrian bronze Sword was bought by
    Colonel Hanbury from the Bedawin at Nardin.<a id="FNanchor_679" href="#Footnote_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a> He could not ascertain
    whence it originally came, but it was probably placed in the hands of a
    statue, perhaps of Maruduk (Mars, father of Nebo or Mercury<a id="FNanchor_680" href="#Footnote_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a>): it
    certainly resembles those with which the god is represented upon the
    Cylinders<a id="FNanchor_681" href="#Footnote_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a> when fighting with the Dragon. The dimensions are:</p>

  <p>And now, proceeding east, we may note that the Persepolis sculptures
    distinctly show, as we might expect, Assyrian and Babylonian
    derivation. The Persians are, despite their prodigious pretensions, a
    comparatively modern people,<a id="FNanchor_684" href="#Footnote_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a> and they were rude enough when armed
    only with sling, lasso, and knife. The date of Hakhámanish (Achæmenes),
    the <i>hero eponymus</i> of the ruling family, can hardly be made to
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>precede <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 700. This was about the time (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
    721–706) when Sargon II. first mentions the Greeks as the Yaha of
    Yatnan (Yunan = Ionia), who sent him tribute from Cyprus and beyond.
    The Medes, before the reign of Cyaxares had conducted the Persians from
    the Caspian regions into Media Magna, were mere barbarians, like the
    Iliyát or Iranian nomades of the present day, who number from a quarter
    to a half of the population. But in starting into life Persia succeeded
    to a rich inheritance—Babylon. To this conquest (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 538)
    she was led by her hero king, Cyrus the Great, or rather Kurush<a id="FNanchor_685" href="#Footnote_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a>
    the elder, son of Cambyses (Xenophon), not father of Cambyses
    (Herodotus), and a contemporary of Darius the Mede.<a id="FNanchor_686" href="#Footnote_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a> Their courage
    and conduct, their loyalty and simplicity, their wise laws, their
    generosity and their love of truth,<a id="FNanchor_687" href="#Footnote_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a> now unhappily extinct, raised
    them in Herodotus’ day to the proud position of ‘Lords of Asia.’</p>

    nations, of which only the six (including Colchians and Caspians)
    wore Swords. The long straight dagger was carried by the Pactyans,
    by the Paphlagonians, by the Thracians, and by the Sagartians, who

  <p>The Indians, afterwards so celebrated for their Swords, were in <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
    480 barbarians dressed in cottons and armed with only cane bows and
    arrows. Of the twelve peoples who supplied the one thousand two
    hundred and seven triremes, the Egyptians had long cutlasses, the
    Cilicians ‘Swords closely resembling the cutlass of the Egyptians,’ the
    Lycians<a id="FNanchor_694" href="#Footnote_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a> daggers and curved falchions, and the Carians daggers and

  <p>Representations of the Persian Acinaces abound in the sculptures
    of Chehel Munar (the Palace of the Forty Columns) at Persepolis.
    Apparently there are two kinds. Porter’s<a id="FNanchor_695" href="#Footnote_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a> illustration (Plate 37)
    shows a handle like the modern weapon sheathed and slung to the right
    side: Ammianus Marcellinus (xiv. 4) and all <span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>classics insist upon this
    unswordsmanlike peculiarity.<a id="FNanchor_696" href="#Footnote_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a> The other (Plate 41), worn by a robed
    Persian, and generally carried in the front-knots of the belt, has a
    crutch-handle and wavy blade, like the Malay Krís (crease). In other
    places (Plates 53 and 54) a human figure stabs the roaring monster in
    the belly with a common ‘Khanjar’-dagger. The traveller considers the
    stout little weapon with broad blade and ferruled sheath apparently
    tied to the right thigh as the Persian Sword of that age, which the
    classics describe as very short. The lineal descendant of this weapon,
    now obsolete in Persia, is the Afghan Charay, a congener of the
    Egyptian flesh-knife Sword.</p>

  <p>According to Quintus Curtius: ‘The Sword-belt of Darius was of gold,
    and from it was suspended his scymitar, the scabbard of which was
    composed of one entire pearl.’ The practice of inlaying blades and
    hilts, still popular in Persia, may explain Herodotus (ix. 80), that
    amongst the spoils taken at Platæa by the Greeks ‘there were acinaces
    with golden ornaments.’ That of Mardonius was long kept as a trophy
    in the temple of Athene-Parthenos in the Athenian Acropolis. On the
    other hand, as was elsewhere done, blades of gold were given <i lang="la">honoris
    causâ</i>. Hence in the ‘Iliad’ (xviii. 597) we see Hephæstus making
    youths with golden cutlasses upon Achilles’ shield. According to
    Xenophon the royal gift of Persia was a golden scymitar, a Nisæan horse
    with golden bridle, and other battle-gear. Herodotus (viii. 120) makes
    Xerxes present the Abderites with a golden scymitar and a tiara, Diana
    is girt with a golden falchion (Herod. viii. 77). The golden blade is
    not unknown to more modern days. In the ‘Chronicles of Dalboquerque’
    (Hakluyt, vol. ii. p. 204) two pages stand behind the King of Cananor,
    one with a Sword of gold and the other with a scymitar of gold. The
    weapons are distinguished from the ‘Swords adorned with gold and
    silver’ (vol. i. 117). The King of Siam also sent to Dom Manoel of
    Portugal ‘a crown and Sword of gold’ (vol. iii. 154). Cuzco supplied a
    unique gold celt.</p>

  <p>The influence of the great Babylonio-Assyrian centre extended Egyptian
    art <span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>and science to farthest Asia. From Iran we pass, with the
    course of civilisation, eastward to India. Here the Hindú proper did
    not succeed in establishing himself amongst the original Turanian
    possessors of Hindustan, or the upper country, before the Eighteenth
    Egyptian Dynasty.<a id="FNanchor_697" href="#Footnote_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a> The South was and is still essentially
    Turanian—witness Malabar and its ‘nepotism.’</p>

  <div class="sidenote">THE SWORD IN INDIA.</div>

  <p>Unfortunately, India preserves no trustworthy Hindú records of the
    past. Although Herodotus called it the ‘most wealthy and populous
    country in the world,’ yet the absence of temples and other ruins
    suggests barbarism when Egypt and Assyria, Greece and Rome, were
    flourishing. While Buddhism is made to date from the sixth century
    <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, and we have subsequent notices of Buddha’s chief
    worshippers,<a id="FNanchor_698" href="#Footnote_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a> there was evidently very little civilisation in
    the days of Alexander (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 327). Nearchus made the Indians
    ‘write letters on cloth smoothed by being well beaten’; and Strabo
    (xv. 1) doubts whether India knew the use of writing. They derived
    their art and literature from Græco-Bactria, and they only degraded
    the former—Art in her highest form never travels far from the
    Mediterranean. The beautiful human animals and <i>mauvais sujets</i> who
    were the citizens of Olympus became in grotesque India blue-skinned,
    many-headed and multi-armed monsters—the abortions of imagination.</p>

  <p>India’s two great epics (‘Mahabhárat’ and ‘Ramáyana’) and fifteen
    Puranas are mere depositories of legendary and imaginative myths,
    containing few of the golden grains of truth hid in tons of rubbish.
    All the anthropology we learn from them is that India had a primitive
    (Turanian?) race, called in contempt Rakshasas or demons. It was
    mastered by Brahminical attacks, typified in later days by Rama and
    other heroes, probably during the exodes of Hyksos and Hebrews from
    Egypt; and long subsequently arose Buddhism, to be followed by the rule
    of the Moslems and Europeans.<a id="FNanchor_699" href="#Footnote_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a></p>

  <p>The Dhanurvidya,<a id="FNanchor_700" href="#Footnote_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a> or Bow-Science, contains the fullest description
    we possess of the ancient Indian arms and war-implements, but the date
    of composition is exceedingly doubtful. The Hindú delights in vast
    numbers. Assuming the population of the earth at one thousand and
    seventy-five billions, his Aksauhini, or complete army, according to
    the Nitiprakáshika, an abstract Dhanurvidya by the sage Vaishampáyana,
    amounts to two thousand one hundred and eighty-seven <span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>millions of foot,
    twenty-one thousand eight hundred and seventy millions of horse, two
    hundred and eighteen thousand seven hundred elephants, and twenty-one
    thousand eight hundred and seventy chariots. The scale of salaries in
    gold<a id="FNanchor_701" href="#Footnote_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a> is equally liberal and absurd.</p>

  <p>The Hindú mind—so far justifying the term ‘Indo-Germanic’—connects
    everything with metaphysics,<a id="FNanchor_702" href="#Footnote_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a> or a something that goes beyond
    physical phenomena. Hence it ascribes all arms and armour to
    supernatural causes. Jáyá, a daughter of primæval Daksha (one of the
    Rishis or sacred sages), became, according to a promise of Brahma,
    the creator, the mother of all weapons, including missiles. These
    are divided into four great classes. The Yantramukta (thrown by
    machines); the Panimukta (hand-thrown); the Muktasandhárita (thrown and
    drawn back) and the Mantramukta (thrown by spells, and numbering six
    species), form the Mukta or thrown class of twelve species. This is
    opposed to the Amukta (unthrown) of twenty species, to the Muktámukta
    (either thrown or not) of ninety-eight varieties,<a id="FNanchor_703" href="#Footnote_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a> and to the
    Báhuyuddha (weapons which the body provides for personal struggles).
    All are personified—for instance, Dhanu, the bow, has a small face,
    a broad neck, a slender waist, and a strong back. He is four cubits
    high and is bent in three places; he has a long tongue, and his mouth
    has terrible tusks; his colour is of blood, and he ever makes a
    gurgling noise; he is covered with garlands of entrails, and he licks
    continually with his tongue the two corners of his mouth.<a id="FNanchor_704" href="#Footnote_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a></p>

  <p>The Sword (Khadga,<a id="FNanchor_705" href="#Footnote_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a> As, or Asi) belongs to the second class.
    According to the sage Vaishampáyana it was a superior weapon,
    introduced especially and separately by Brahma, who produced
    ‘Asidevatá.’ This ‘Sword-god’ appeared on the summit of the Himálayas
    shaking earth’s foundations and illuminating the sky. Brahma entrusted
    the arm, then fifty thumbs long and four thumbs broad, to Shiva
    (Rudra), still its supreme deity, in order to free the world from the
    Asuras or mighty dæmons. Shiva, after his success, passed it on to
    Vishnu, the latter to Marici, and he to Indra. The Air-god conferred
    it upon the guardians of the World-quarters, and these to Manu, the
    son of the Sun, for use against evil-doers. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>Since that time it has
    remained in his family. The Khadga has a total of nine names: carried
    on the left side and handled in thirty-two different ways, the weapon
    became a universal favourite. Amongst the four arts to be studied
    besides the Káma-Shastra (<i>Ars Amoris</i>), women are enjoined by the
    Sage Vatsya (Part I. p. 26)<a id="FNanchor_706" href="#Footnote_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a> to practise with Sword, single-stick,
    quarterstaff, and bow and arrow.’</p>

  <p>The Ili (hand-sword, p. 17) is two cubits long and five fingers
    broad; the front part is curved; there is no hand-guard, and four
    movements are peculiar to it. The Prasa, or spear, in some works
    becomes a broadsword. The uterine brother of the Sword is the Pattisha
    or two-bladed battle-axe. The Asidhenu (dagger), the ‘sister of the
    Sword and worn by kings,’ is a three-edged blade, one cubit long, two
    thumbs broad, without hand-guard, carried in the belt, and used in
    hand-to-hand conflict. The Maushtika (fist-Sword, stiletto<a id="FNanchor_707" href="#Footnote_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a>) is
    only a span long, and thus very handy for all kinds of movements.</p>

  <p>The sage Vaishampáyana, a pandit or pedant lecturing on the Art of
    War, warns us that the ‘Efficiency of the weapon is subject to great
    changes. In different ages and places the quality of an arm is not the
    same, for the material and mode of construction greatly vary. Moreover,
    much depends upon the strength and ability of the person using such
    weapons, in preserving, increasing, or diminishing their efficiency.’
    It may also be remarked that many of his weapons appear to be the
    results of a brain quickened by opium or hashísh.</p>

  <p>The sage Shukra, or Preceptor of the Dæmons, also discourses learnedly,
    in his ‘Shukraniti,’ on armies and weapons, including firearms.
    The only practical part <span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>of chap. v. (Oppert, pp. 82–144) is his
    description of the lucky and unlucky marks on horses. The Arabs have a
    similar system, and a horse with inauspicious signs sells, however well
    bred, for a small sum. And there is wisdom in verse 242 (p. 124):—</p>

  <p>As regards the Sword, Shukra says (Lib. iv. sect. vii. p. 109, verse

  <p>The Sword is a little curved and one-bladed; it is four-fingers broad,
    and sharp-pointed as a razor; it extends up to the navel, has a strong
    hilt, and is brilliant as the beautiful moon. The Khadga (two-handed
    Sword) is four cubits (or six feet) long,<a id="FNanchor_708" href="#Footnote_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a> broad at the hilt, and
    at the end-point sharp like a razor.</p>

  <p>From neither of these works do we learn anything about an interesting
    subject—the elephant-Sword. It is mentioned by the Italian traveller
    Ludovico di Varthema (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1503–1508), who makes it two
    fathoms long and attached to the trunk. Athanasius Nikitin calls it a
    scythe. Knox in his ‘Ceylon’ also speaks of a sharp iron with a socket
    of three edges ‘placed on the teeth’ (tusks?). It was probably derived
    from the West. Antigonus, the great elephantarch; Seleucus, and Pyrrhus
    armed their beasts with ‘sharp points of steel in the tusks’—veritable
    Swords. In Da Gama’s day each animal wore ten blades, five to the
    tusk.<a id="FNanchor_709" href="#Footnote_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a></p>

  <p>It must be borne in mind that upper India about the beginning of our
    æra was mostly Buddhist, and consequently she bred men of peace.
    Yet the caves and the cave-temples supply in bas-relief specimens
    of Sword-bearers, and even of free fights. The weapon is mostly the
    short stout blade, corresponding with the Persian Acinaces, but worn
    in modern fashion on the left side. Mr. James Fergusson has kindly
    supplied me with two illustrations. The first (fig. 235) is the
    battle-scene <span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>showing two Swords. A huge chopper or falchion, with a
    tooth on the back, is wielded in the left hand, the right supporting
    the shield.<a id="FNanchor_710" href="#Footnote_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a> The other, straight with one median ridge, is broad
    at the end instead of being pointed. The second (fig. 236), which Mr.
    Fergusson calls the ‘first Highlander,’ is of the same date, and it
    shows very distinctly the handle—which might be modern—the sheath,
    and the mode of wearing. It is more distinct in the photograph than in
    the woodcut made by the author’s artist.</p>

  <p>The temple-caves of Elephanta or Gharapuri (cave-town) in the Bay of
    Bombay, described by Forbes and Heber, Dr. Wilson and Mr. Burgess,
    show a very different and superior article. This comparatively
    modern basilica—burrowed out of the rock and dedicated to Shiva or
    Mahadeva, the third person of the Hindu Triad, and the representative
    of destructive-reproduction in his Trimurti or triple form—contains
    a multitude of alt-reliefs from ten to fourteen feet high, and so
    prominent that they are almost ‘undercut,’ joined to the parent-rock
    only by the back. At the north-east angle stands the figure of the hero
    Arjuna, the presumed ancestor of the Pandya Princes. This

    with a bevelled point like the Roman; there is a small hand-guard; the

    still the fashion throughout India.</p>

  <p>Professor Oppert informs us<a id="FNanchor_713" href="#Footnote_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a> that the Arka (<i>Calatropis gigantea</i>),
    the huge swallow-wort with milky and blistering juice, which grows wild
    all over the peninsula, if ‘used with discretion when iron is being
    forged, contributes greatly to the excellence <span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>of the Indian steel.’
    The simple is well known to the native alchemist, to the doctor, and
    to the vet., but I was not aware of its being generally applied to
    iron-working.</p>

  <p>I reserve for Part II. details concerning the modern Indian Sword
    and the blades imitated from it. Lieutenant-Colonel Pollok (Madras
    Staff Corps)<a id="FNanchor_714" href="#Footnote_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a> describes, unfortunately without illustration, the
    Burmese Dalwel (‘Dalwey,’ vol. ii. p. 18) or fighting-Sword, a ‘nasty
    two-handed weapon with a blade about two feet long, and as sharp as a
    razor’ (i. 51). He also notices the Dha, or Dhaw, a knife six inches
    long, equally fitted for domestic use and stabbing.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—My lamented friend Dr. Burnell, whose loss to
      Anglo-Oriental philology is so deeply felt, took a notable
      part in reducing Hindú claims to remote antiquity. Whereas Sir
      William Jones, a <i>littérateur</i> thoroughly well imposed upon,
      dated the Laws of Menu from <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1280, Burnell boldly
      assigned them to the fourth century <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, and partly
      to a much later period. The Theatre of Kalidása (Sakuntala,
      Urwasi, &amp;c.) he has attributed to the sixth century instead of
      the first; in fact he leaves nothing to <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> but parts
      of the Vedas and the earliest Buddhist texts.</p>

    <p>We can accept the reform unhesitatingly. The oldest Hindú
      inscription (Girnár) dates from about <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 250;
      the oldest Cave-temple from still later. The alphabet is a
      lineal descendant from the Egypto-Phœnician. The earliest
      Hindú buildings were wooden: India had no architecture which
      could vie with those of Greece or monarchical Rome, much less
      with the mighty works of Egypt and Mesopotamia. The Hindú’s
      ‘iron-built’ cities were probably clay-walled settlements.
      His mythology was Egyptian tempered with Greek: for instance,
      the four Yugas or periods, in the fourth of which (Kali, the
      black Yuga) we now are. And considering how early Christianity
      found its way into the Peninsula, and the highly subjective
      and receptive nature of the people, I cannot but believe
      that they borrowed largely from the sacred writings of the
      stranger. It is easier to hold that Christ originated, or at
      least influenced, Krishna, than with Volney to hold Krishna
      the original of Christ. In 1852 Mr. Pocock wrote about ‘India
      in Greece’; in 1883 we want a change of venue to ‘Greece in
      India.’ ‘Yavana’ (Greek) entered India with Alexander, and this
      gives a <i lang="la">terminus a quo</i> though not <i lang="la">ad quem</i>.</p>

    between <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 880–830. The contemporaneity of the bards, their

  <p class="noindent">and we have come to look upon Homer as one of the Homeridæ, the <i>heros
    eponymus</i> of the bards who produced the ‘Iliad’ and the ‘Odyssey.’</p>

  <p>Assuming, with Dr. Schliemann, the date of the Trojan war at about
    <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 1200,<a id="FNanchor_716" href="#Footnote_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a> Homer, according to the ‘Father of History,’
    would flourish about four centuries and a half after the wars he sang.</p>

  <p>‘I wish I could have proved Homer to have been an eye-witness of
    the Trojan war. Alas, I cannot do it! At his time swords were of
    universal use, and iron was known, whereas they were totally unknown at
    Troy.<a id="FNanchor_717" href="#Footnote_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a> Besides, the civilisation he describes is later by centuries
    than that which I have brought to light in the excavations. Homer
    gives us the legend of Ilium’s tragic fate as it was handed down to
    him by preceding bards, clothing the traditional facts of the war and
    destruction of Troy in the garb of his own day.’<a id="FNanchor_718" href="#Footnote_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a></p>

  <p>Metallurgically speaking, the sacred Bards and Heroes of Hellas,
    whose works formed the Holy Writ of Greece,<a id="FNanchor_719" href="#Footnote_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a> lived at the height
    of the Copper and in the beginning of the Iron Ages. Metal, not yet
    cast (<span lang="grc">χωνευτόν</span>), would be worked in <span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>primitive fashion with the hammer
    (<span lang="grc">σφῦρα = σφυρήλατον</span>),<a id="FNanchor_720" href="#Footnote_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a> and there were two manners of hammer-work,
    the Holosphyraton, in solid mass, and the Sphyraton or plate-work.
    Casting and soldering were invented (for the Greeks), according to
    Pausanias<a id="FNanchor_721" href="#Footnote_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a> and Pliny,<a id="FNanchor_722" href="#Footnote_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a> shortly after Homer’s day by the Samians
    Rhœcus and Theodorus. The latter, who lived between <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 800
    and 700, may have introduced core-casting, so well known to Egypt
    and Assyria. The joints would be united by the normal mechanical
    means,<a id="FNanchor_723" href="#Footnote_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a> and the ornamental house-plates would be attached to the
    walls and floors with nails and studs. The idea of the firmament being
    a copper dome vault is known to Pindar as well as to the ‘Iliad’
    and the ‘Odyssey.’<a id="FNanchor_724" href="#Footnote_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a> Tartarus, below Hades,<a id="FNanchor_725" href="#Footnote_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a> had a similar
    threshold, and Atlas in Euripides had copper shoulders.<a id="FNanchor_726" href="#Footnote_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a></p>

  <p>Ornamentation (<span lang="grc">δαιδάλλειν</span>) was applied with gravers, burins, and
    similar instruments; to domestic implements (cups and goblets, craters
    or bowls, cauldrons and tripods); to sacred vases for the temple; and
    to trumpets,<a id="FNanchor_727" href="#Footnote_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a> arms, and armour. Besides the brazier (<span lang="grc">χαλκεὺς</span>) we

  <p>The Homeric bards<a id="FNanchor_729" href="#Footnote_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a> and Hesiod are well acquainted with iron
    (<span lang="grc">σίδηρος</span>),<a id="FNanchor_730" href="#Footnote_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a> and with steel in its various forms—Cyanus, Adámas,
    and Chalyps. The former mentions seven metals, the Haft-Júsh (‘seven
    boilings’), which he, like the Persians, had learned from Egypt.
    Quenching in water, or tempering, was well known to the ‘Odyssey,’ as
    we learn from the sputtering of Polyphemus’ eye<a id="FNanchor_731" href="#Footnote_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a>:—</p>

    should be translated, not ‘hoary,’ but ‘iron-grey.’ The ‘black’
    (dark-blue) ‘Cyanus’ (<span lang="grc">κύανος</span>) mentioned by the ‘Iliad,’<a id="FNanchor_735" href="#Footnote_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a> would be

    and tempered metal; while <span lang="grc">χάλυψ</span> (steel in general) either named or was
    named by the well-known Chalybes. That the harder substance was not
    rare, we see by the injunction,<a id="FNanchor_738" href="#Footnote_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a> ‘Do not, at a festive banquet of
    the gods, pare from the five-pointed branch (hand) with bright steel,
    the dry from the fresh’: i.e. don’t cut your nails at dinner. So at
    the Battle of the Ships,<a id="FNanchor_739" href="#Footnote_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a> Homer studs a great sea-fighting Xyston
    (pole), twenty-two cubits long, with spikes of iron; and elsewhere
    speaks of a ‘cyanus-footed table.’<a id="FNanchor_740" href="#Footnote_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a></p>

  <p>Yet copper was <em>the</em> metal for arms and armour. While the shield of
    Hercules was made of alabaster (not ‘gypsum’), ivory, elektron (the
    mixed metal) and (pure) gold, the hero is armed with a ‘short spear
    tipped with gleaming copper’;<a id="FNanchor_741" href="#Footnote_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a> and he fastens around his shoulders
    a ‘Sword, the averter of destruction,’ which the context suggests to
    be of the same material. The ‘fair-haired Danaë’s son, equestrian
    Perseus,’<a id="FNanchor_742" href="#Footnote_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a> bears a Sword of copper with iron sheath hanging by a
    felt-thong (<span lang="grc">μελάνδετον ἄορ</span>).<a id="FNanchor_743" href="#Footnote_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a> The seven-hide shield of Ajax<a id="FNanchor_744" href="#Footnote_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a>
    was <span lang="grc">χάλκεος</span>, of copper—not ‘brass-bound’ as Lord Derby has it. The
    lambs’ throats are cut with the ‘cruel copper’ (<span lang="grc">χαλκός</span>),<a id="FNanchor_745" href="#Footnote_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a> and
    Diomede pursues Venus with the same weapon.<a id="FNanchor_746" href="#Footnote_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a> Hephaistos makes for
    Achilles a shield of gold and silver, copper and tin;<a id="FNanchor_747" href="#Footnote_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a> and canny
    Diomede’s armour<a id="FNanchor_748" href="#Footnote_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a> is of copper, which he changes for gold, ‘the
    value of a hundred beeves for the value of nine.’</p>

  <p>In the ‘Iliad’ close-handed combat succeeds to missile-using. As
    Strabo remarks,<a id="FNanchor_749" href="#Footnote_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a> Homer makes his warriors begin their duellos by
    weapon-throwing and then take to their Swords. But the latter is <em>the</em>
    weapon, rivalled only by the hand-spear. Hence the Egyptian-taught
    Argives are insulted as arrow-throwers;<a id="FNanchor_750" href="#Footnote_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a> and Diomede reviles his
    foe as ‘an archer and woman’s man.’<a id="FNanchor_751" href="#Footnote_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a> The taunts are still known to
    savage tribes of modern day.</p>

  <p>The Homeric Sword has five names. The first is <i>Chalcos</i> (copper,
    and perhaps base metal), used like the Latin <i>ferrum</i>. The second
    is <i>Xiphos</i>, a word still generic in Romaic poetry and prose; the
    diminutive being <i>Xiphidion</i>. The third is <i>Phásganon</i>, pronounced
    Phásg<em>h</em>anon,<a id="FNanchor_752" href="#Footnote_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a> and the fourth is <i>Aor</i>. Thrace,<a id="FNanchor_753" href="#Footnote_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a> a famous
    manufactory of art-works even in early ages, produced the best
    and largest of these <span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>blades; we find a Thracian Xiphos, possibly
    of steel, ‘beautiful and long,’ in the hands of the Trojan prince
    Helenos;<a id="FNanchor_754" href="#Footnote_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a> and Achilles at the funeral games offers as a prize
    a Thracian Phásganon, fair and silver-studded.<a id="FNanchor_755" href="#Footnote_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a> This hero<a id="FNanchor_756" href="#Footnote_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a>
    was drawing his mighty Xiphos<a id="FNanchor_757" href="#Footnote_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a> from the sheath (<span lang="grc">κολεός</span>, <i>culeus</i>,
    <i>vagina</i>, scabbard) to assault Agamemnon, when at Athene’s instance,
    ‘still holding his heavy hand upon the silver hilt, he thrust back the
    great Sword into the scabbard.’ The Xiphos with silver studs or bosses
    occurs in sundry places,<a id="FNanchor_758" href="#Footnote_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a> and one, with a gold hilt and a silver
    scabbard fitted with golden rings, belongs to Agamemnon. Dr. Schliemann
    explains the epithet <span lang="grc">Πάμφαινον</span><a id="FNanchor_759" href="#Footnote_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a> by the line of gold bosses lying
    near one of the Swords; they were broader than the blade and covered
    the whole available space along the sheath. Thus the Homerid’s Helos
    (<span lang="grc">ἥλος</span>), usually rendered ‘stud’ or ‘nail,’ was applied to the bosses,
    or buttons, that break the mid-rib or that stud the blade near the
    handle.<a id="FNanchor_760" href="#Footnote_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a> Paris slings on a copper silver-studded Xiphos.<a id="FNanchor_761" href="#Footnote_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a>
    Menelaus, with the same weapon, strikes off his enemy’s Phalos—the
    helmet-ridge bearing the Lóphos-tube which confines the Hippouris or
    horse-tail crest. Patroclus, when arming himself,<a id="FNanchor_762" href="#Footnote_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a> hangs from
    his shoulders the silver-studded Xiphos of copper (<span lang="grc">ξίφον ἀργυρόηλον,

    Lycon,<a id="FNanchor_764" href="#Footnote_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a> having missed each other with the spear, ran on with the
    Xiphos, which is here again called Phásganon; but Lycon’s weapon broke
    at the hilt (<span lang="grc">καυλός</span> = <i>caulis</i>), and the Xiphos of Peneleos ‘entered,
    and only the skin retained it; the head hung down and the limbs were
    relaxed.’ On the shield of Achilles<a id="FNanchor_765" href="#Footnote_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a> Hephaistos<a id="FNanchor_766" href="#Footnote_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a> figures youths

  <p>Opposed to the Xiphos, a straight ‘rapier blade,’ as we shall presently
    see, was the <span lang="grc">φάσγανον</span> or dirk, probably a throwing-weapon like the
    Scax and Scramasax. The two are often confounded in the dictionaries.
    Phásganon is supposed to be <i>quasi</i> <span lang="grc">Σφάγανον</span>, a euphonic transposition,
    like the verb <span lang="grc">φασγάνειν</span> (to slay with the Sword). The root is evidently
    <span lang="grc">Σφαγ</span>, which appears in <span lang="grc">σφάγη</span> (slaughter) and in <span lang="grc">σφάγειν</span> (to slay):
    there is also a form <span lang="grc">φάσλανον</span> for <span lang="grc">σφάλανον</span>. This is a two-edged
    leaf-shaped blade (<span lang="grc">φάσγανον ἄμφηκες</span>):<a id="FNanchor_767" href="#Footnote_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a> Thrasymedes gives one to
    Diomede, and with it Rhesus is slaughtered in his sleep. The word
    frequently occurs: black-hilted Phásgana, with massive handles, are
    mentioned,<a id="FNanchor_768" href="#Footnote_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a> and the common Phásganon is found in <span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>‘Odys.’ xi. 48;
    in Pindar (N, 1. 80), and in the Tragedians. In another passage,<a id="FNanchor_769" href="#Footnote_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a>
    however, it becomes a large (<span lang="grc">μέγα</span>) Phásganon.</p>

  <p>The fourth term is <span lang="grc">ἄορ</span>,<a id="FNanchor_770" href="#Footnote_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a> usually set down, like the English
    ‘brand,’ as poetical; it is not used in Romaic and the Neo-Greek
    dictionaries ignore it. The Aor seems to mean a broad, stout, strong
    blade. With the sharp Aor (<span lang="grc">ἄορ ὀξὺ</span>) drawn from his thigh, Ulysses digs
    the furrow one cubit wide,<a id="FNanchor_771" href="#Footnote_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a> and Hector cuts in two the ashen spear
    of Ajax.<a id="FNanchor_772" href="#Footnote_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a> Automedon draws a long Aor.<a id="FNanchor_773" href="#Footnote_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a> This, too, is the weapon
    of earth-shaking Neptune, the ‘dreadful tapering Sword’ (<span lang="grc">τανύηκες
    ἄορ</span>),<a id="FNanchor_774" href="#Footnote_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a> ‘thunder-bolt-like, wherewith it is not possible to engage
    in fatal fight, for the fear of it restrains mankind.’<a id="FNanchor_775" href="#Footnote_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a> Phœbus
    Apollo has a golden Aor (<span lang="grc">χρυσάωρ</span>).<a id="FNanchor_776" href="#Footnote_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a> Here we see the vague meaning
    of the poetic word, like our ‘hanger,’ for it now means the god’s
    golden bow and quiver carried on the shoulder.</p>

  <p>Homer’s fifth is the <span lang="grc">Μάχαιρα</span>, hung by a single belt close to the
    Sword-sheath, and used for sacrifices and similar uses. It afterwards
    became a favourite with the Lacedæmonians; it was then a curved blade,
    as opposed to the Xiphos or uncurved. Again, in Plutarch and other
    writers, the Machæra seems to mean—like Spatha—a long straight
    blade. Homer does not mention the κοπὶς, but Euripides uses it<a id="FNanchor_777" href="#Footnote_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a> in
    conjunction with Machæra.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>THE SWORD IN HOMER.</i></div>

  <p>We must not expect to see the Sword so frequently drawn in the
    ‘Odyssey,’ which, <i>pace</i> Mr. Sayce, appears later than the ‘Iliad.’
    We note in it more character and less movement; more unity and
    less digression, and, finally, less fighting and more amenity and
    civilisation. But ‘Othyssefs,’ the ‘man with whom many were wroth,’
    has been a soldier, and he does not forget his old trade. Besides,
    commerce was still armed barter, and voyaging was enlivened by piracy.
    Copper, or base metal, continues to be the basis of metallurgy, and
    the hero owns it in quantities, besides gold, silver, and electrum.
    Euryalus tells Alcinous that he will appease the guest (Ulysses) with
    an all-copper brand (<span lang="grc">ἄορ παγχάλκεον</span>), whose hilt (<span lang="grc">κώπη</span>) is silver, and
    whose scabbard is of newly sawn ivory.<a id="FNanchor_778" href="#Footnote_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a> The suitors would slay
    Telemachus with the sharp copper.<a id="FNanchor_779" href="#Footnote_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a> In the final struggle, the
    catastrophe of the poem, Eurymachus, drawing his sharp Sword of copper,
    calls upon his friends to do the same, and to shield themselves with
    the tables against the fast-flying shafts. In the ‘Frogs and Mice,’ the
    spear is a good long needle; the ‘all-copper work of Mars.’<a id="FNanchor_780" href="#Footnote_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a></p>

  <p>Wrought iron is prominent in the ‘Odyssey’ as in the ‘Iliad.’
    Athene-Mentes<a id="FNanchor_781" href="#Footnote_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a> sails over the dark sea to Temesa (Temessus) for
    copper, and also brings <span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>back shining iron (<span lang="grc">αἴθωνα σίδηρον</span>). Menelaus
    does the same.<a id="FNanchor_782" href="#Footnote_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a> The ‘cruel iron’ balances the ‘cruel copper.’<a id="FNanchor_783" href="#Footnote_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a>
    The ‘long-pointed iron,’ so fatal to the Trojans, is apparently the
    spear, which began the duels. Prudent Penelope places the bow and
    the grey iron (<span lang="grc">πολιόν τε σίδηρον</span>) ready for the suitors;<a id="FNanchor_784" href="#Footnote_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a> and
    the Palace contains store of wrought iron (<span>πολύκμητος σίδηρος</span>).<a id="FNanchor_785" href="#Footnote_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a>
    The axe (<span lang="grc">πέλεκυς</span>), sharpened on both sides,<a id="FNanchor_786" href="#Footnote_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a> is of copper; but
    the hatchets, through whose rings or handle-holes (<span lang="grc">στειλειὴ</span>) the
    copper-tipped arrows must be shot, are of iron.<a id="FNanchor_787" href="#Footnote_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a> ‘Iron,’ we are
    told, ‘of itself draws on a man’<a id="FNanchor_788" href="#Footnote_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a> (Tacit. ‘Hist.’ i. 80), a
    sentiment repeated elsewhere in the same words.<a id="FNanchor_789" href="#Footnote_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a> And the Sword
    is alluded to in more than one place without the material being
    specified.<a id="FNanchor_790" href="#Footnote_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a></p>

  <p>In the ‘Hymn to Hermes,’<a id="FNanchor_791" href="#Footnote_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a> Mercury the god ‘vivisects’ the mountain
    tortoise with a scalpel of grey iron (<span lang="grc">γλυφάνῳ πολιοῖο σίδηρου</span>). The
    Glyphanus was a carving-tool, a chisel, or a knife for reed-pens.</p>

  <p>The dispute whether the so-called Homeric poems were written or were
    orally preserved still awaits sentence. We twice find the word <span lang="grc">γράφειν</span>,
    but its primary meaning is ‘to mark,’ ‘to cut,’ and, lastly, ‘to
    write.’ Thus Ajax,<a id="FNanchor_792" href="#Footnote_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a> when inscribing (<span lang="grc">ἐπιγράψας</span>) the lot, might
    simply have scraped upon it ‘Ajax his mark.’ Yet there is nothing
    against writing, and there is much in its favour. For instance—</p>

  <p class="noindent">‘Having on tablet writ’ can mean nothing else. Pliny<a id="FNanchor_794" href="#Footnote_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a> accepts this
    writing given to Bellerophon on codicilli or tablets.<a id="FNanchor_795" href="#Footnote_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a> Horace, who
    was not only a great poet, but a masterful genius, mentions writing
    in Homer’s day, and makes the early inscriptions laws cut into wood
    (<i lang="la">leges incidere ligno</i>). Herodotus<a id="FNanchor_796" href="#Footnote_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a> tells us that he himself saw
    Cadmeian (that is, old Phœnician) characters; and the tradition is
    that Danaus introduced letters from Egypt, which, I repeat, produced
    the one alphabet the world knows. Dr. Schliemann (‘Troy,’ Appendix by
    the Editor) found at seven and a half mètres (twenty-five feet) below
    the surface of the so-called Homeric Troy, many short inscriptions
    in ‘ancient Cypriote characters,’ and as many Greek epigraphs were
    discovered at Mycenæ. Evidently the ‘Iliad’ and the ‘Odyssey’ might
    have been cut in rude Phœnician characters upon wooden tablets or
    scratched on plates of lead. Professor Paley would date the literary
    Homer from <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 400; but that is a different phase of the
    subject.</p>

  <p>Herodotus is the outcome of Homer, or, if you please, of the Homerids
    and of Æschylus. The work of this prose rhapsodist, besides being a
    history, a logography, a record of travel, and a study of ethnology and
    antiquity, is at once an Epic and a Drama. It is epic in the heroic and
    romantic tone; in the unity of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>action, a mighty invasion-campaign; and
    in the frequent digressions which aid, if they retard, the one primary
    object. It is a tragedy in the scenic displays (the review of Xerxes,
    for instance), in the action of Destiny, the circle of Necessity, the
    Nemesiac hypothesis, and the jealousy of the gods (<i>Deus ultor</i>); while
    the catastrophe is represented in ‘Calliope’ by the destruction of the
    Persian host, the home-return of the victors, and the lurid scenes at
    the close. It ends with an epigram, a kind of <i lang="la">Vos plaudite</i>: ‘The
    Persians ... chose rather to dwell in a churlish land and exercise
    lordship, than to plough the plains and be slaves of other men’—a
    sentiment which would ‘bring down the house’ in the Highlands. All
    is written with a distinct purpose, and the sensible chronology is
    derived from Egypt. There is something poetical, too, in the enormous
    numbers. The magnificent-impossible host of five millions two hundred
    and eighty-three thousand two hundred and twenty men,<a id="FNanchor_797" href="#Footnote_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a> and the
    one thousand three hundred and twenty-seven triremes to be defeated
    and destroyed by a handful of nine thousand Greeks and three hundred
    and seventy-eight ships, is highly imaginative. The philosophic and
    sceptical modern mind will hardly be satisfied till the details are
    confirmed by the contemporary evidence of inscriptions, for instance,
    the Behistun, which is a running commentary upon ‘Thalia.’ Hellas ever
    was, and is, and will be, by virtue of her mighty intellect and her
    preponderating imagination, ‘Græcia mendax.’ Eastern history tells us
    nothing about the marvellous Persian invasion. We may fairly believe
    that there was a great movement headed by some powerful Satrap,<a id="FNanchor_798" href="#Footnote_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a>
    who determined to crush the wasp’s nest to the West; but we can go
    no farther. It is simply incredible that the Great King, who at
    the time was Lord Paramount of the civilised world, should lead to
    so little purpose millions of warriors—men, the flower of Asia,
    whose portraiture is the most favourable of any we possess, and whom
    the Father owns to have been not a whit inferior in prowess to the
    Greeks.<a id="FNanchor_799" href="#Footnote_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a> And for this view I duly apologise to ‘Herodotus and his
    shade.’</p>

  <p>The poet-historian gives an interesting description of the Sword
    amongst the Scythians whom the Greeks and Persians call Sacæ (Shakas)
    or Nomades.<a id="FNanchor_800" href="#Footnote_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a> To judge from Hindú legend—for instance, that of
    Shak-ari, ‘foe to the Shakas,’ a title of the historical Vikramáditya
    (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 79)—the Sacæ were ‘Turanians’—Mongols or Tartars.
    When he makes them worship Ares-Mars, he probably derives the
    idea from their adoring the emblem of war, an iron dirk (<span lang="grc">ἀκινάκης
    σιδήρεος</span>).<a id="FNanchor_801" href="#Footnote_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a> ‘A blade of antique iron,’ he tells us, ‘is placed on
    the summit of every such mound (a flat-topped pile of brushwood three
    furlongs square), and serves as the image of Mars; yearly sacrifices
    are made to it.’ The victims were cattle, horses, and one per cent.
    of war-prisoners. ‘Libations of wine are first <span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>poured upon their
    heads, after which they are slaughtered over a vase, and the vessel
    is then carried up to the top of the pile and the blood poured upon
    the Akinákes.<a id="FNanchor_802" href="#Footnote_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a> In the Scythian graves of Russian Cimmeria (the
    Crimea) and of Tartary, the Swords are mostly bronze. Dr. M‘Pherson,
    however, found one of iron (1839) in the great tomb of Kertch, the old
    Milesian Panticapæum, so called from its river, Anticapes;<a id="FNanchor_803" href="#Footnote_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a> it was
    a short dagger-like thrusting blade, resembling the old Persian, with
    mid-rib and curved handle. In the days of Attila, a Sword, supposed to
    be one of the ancient Scythian weapons alluded to by the Greek, was
    accidentally found, and was made an object of worship.<a id="FNanchor_804" href="#Footnote_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a> Janghíz
    (Genghis) Khan when raised to the throne repeated this sacrificial
    observance, which, however, can scarcely be called a ‘Mongolic
    custom.’<a id="FNanchor_805" href="#Footnote_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a> It seems common to the Sauromatæ (northern Medes and
    Slavs), the Alans, the Huns, and the tribes that wandered over the
    Steppes.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>THE SWORD IN HERODOTUS.</i></div>

  <p>The Scythians also swore by the emblem of Mars. ‘Their oaths,’ says
    Herodotus,<a id="FNanchor_806" href="#Footnote_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a> ‘are accompanied by the following ceremonies. Into a
    large earthen bowl (<span lang="grc">κύλιξ</span>) pouring wine, they mingle with it blood of
    the parties to the oath, who wound themselves superficially with a
    knife or an awl; then they dip into the bowl an Akinákes, and arrows,
    and a battle-axe (<i>sagaris</i>), and a javelin (<i>akontion</i>), all the while
    repeating manifold prayers. Lastly, the two contracting parties drink
    each a draught from the bowl, as do also the most worthy of their
    followers.’<a id="FNanchor_807" href="#Footnote_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a> In the ‘Anabasis,’<a id="FNanchor_808" href="#Footnote_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a> the Greeks swear by dipping a
    Sword, and the barbarians a lance, into the victim’s blood.</p>

  <p>So far these ancient authors: we must now see how they are confirmed
    by modern authorities. Dr. Schliemann’s investigations at Mycenæ<a id="FNanchor_809" href="#Footnote_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a>
    are the more interesting, as the finds are supposed by him to be
    synchronous with those of Burnt Troy; and they enable us to compare
    the former in her prosperity with the latter in her exhaustion. The
    energetic explorer doughtily supports the use of copper for arms and
    utensils; and, with whole truth, makes it the staple metal of the
    heroic ages. As he found no tin at Mycenæ or in the great layer of
    copper scoriæ at Hisárlik (Troy), while ‘Kassiteros’ is repeatedly
    mentioned by Homer, he contends that the bronze of the Greek city was
    imported, and therefore rare and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>expensive. Unfortunately he did not
    analyse the thin copper wire which carried the necklace-beads.</p>

  <p>It is a new sensation to descend with Dr. Schliemann into the
    old Mycenian tombs where sixteen or seventeen corpses had been
    simultaneously interred (?). Sepulchre No. I, attributed to Agamemnon
    and his two heralds,<a id="FNanchor_810" href="#Footnote_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a> produced a variety of interesting articles,
    especially the golden shoulder-belt (<span lang="grc">τελαμών</span>) that decorated the
    mummy.<a id="FNanchor_811" href="#Footnote_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a> My photograph shows it attached to a fragmentary two-edged
    Sword. Between the middle and the southern body lay a heap of broken
    bronze blades, which may have represented sixty whole Swords: some
    bore traces of gilding, and several had gold pins at the handle. Two
    blades lay to the right of the body, and their ornamentation strikingly
    resembled the description in the ‘Iliad.’<a id="FNanchor_812" href="#Footnote_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a> The handle of the larger
    Sword (No. 460) is of bronze, thickly plated with intaglio’d gold; and
    a broad plate of the same metal, similarly worked, passes round the
    shoulders of the Sword. The wooden scabbard must have been adorned with
    golden studs and a long broad plate (fig. 244), shaped somewhat like a
    man, with a ring issuing from the neck. The other Sword in a similar
    style of art seems to have been even richer. Dr. Schliemann<a id="FNanchor_813" href="#Footnote_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a>
    considers No. 463 (fig. 245) a remarkable battle-axe, of which
    fourteen were found in the ‘Trojan treasure.’<a id="FNanchor_814" href="#Footnote_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a> It is evidently a
    Sword-blade, and the same may be said of Nos. 464, 465 (fig. 244).</p>

  <p>At the distance of hardly more than one foot to the right of the
    mummy-body were found eleven bronze Swords; two were tolerably
    preserved, and both were of unusual size—two feet ten inches and three
    feet two inches. The golden plate of the wooden Sword-handle is given
    in p. 305. These weapons, also, had gold plates attached to the pommels
    by twelve pins of the same metal with large globular heads. The body at
    the south end of Sepulchre I. was provided with fifteen bronze Swords,
    of which ten had been placed at its feet. As a rule, the wooden sheaths
    had mouldered away, but the gold studs or bosses, which adorned them
    like the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>binding of a book, lay along the remains of the warriors
    who had wielded them. The whetstone (Sepulchre I.) was of very fine
    sandstone.</p>

  <p>The fourth Sepulchre was almost as interesting in its supply of
    Swords. Excavating from east to west, the explorer came upon a heap of
    more than twenty bronze blades, most of them with remnants of wooden
    scabbards and handles. The flat, round pieces of wood, and the small
    shield-like or button-like disks of gold with intaglio-work, seemed to
    have been glued in unbroken series along both sides of the sheath; and,
    the largest being at the broad end with a gradual diminishing in size,
    they determined the width. The wooden hilts bore similar plates of
    intaglio’d gold; the remaining space had been studded with gold pins,
    and gold nails were fixed in the large pommels of wood or alabaster.
    The quantity of fine gold-dust left no doubt that the handles and
    scabbards had been gilt. The smith evidently did not possess the
    knowledge of gilding silver: he first plated the metal with copper and
    then the copper with gold. The golden cylinder (No. 366), adorned at
    both ends with a broad border of wave-lines, and the field filled with
    interwoven spirals, all intaglio-work, probably belonged to a heft of
    wood. Along the middle runs a row of pin-holes; there are four flat
    pin-heads, and in the centre is the head of a larger stud by which it
    is attached.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span></p>

  <p>Sepulchre IV. also yielded forty-six bronze Swords, more or less
    fragmentary. Of these ten were short and single-edged: their solid
    metal measured when entire from two to two feet three inches in
    length. The handles are too thick for mounting in wood, and the tangs
    end in rings for suspension to the ‘Telamon’ or to the girdle (<span>ζώνη,
    ζωστήρ</span>). The chopper-shaped blade (fig. 246), evidently of Egyptian
    derivation, is broken at the point, which may incline either way,
    probably inwards. The other (fig. 246) is the normal leaf-shape. Dr.
    Schliemann believes<a id="FNanchor_815" href="#Footnote_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a> that they explain the Homeric <span lang="grc">φάσγανον</span>, which
    he makes ‘perfectly synonymous with Xiphos and Aor.’ Here I venture to
    differ with him, holding the Phásganon probably to have been the short
    Egyptian Sword, used like the boomerang-blade for throwing as well as
    cutting.</p>

  <p>The double-edged weapon with the long narrow tube (<span lang="grc">αὐλός</span>) was judged
    to be a dagger-knife, the hollow being intended to save weight; to me
    it appears a lance-head, and the attached ring seems to prove its use
    (fig. 247). The fragmentary two-edged blade of bronze (<i>a</i> fig. 249)
    shows a mid-rib broken by serrations intended either for ornament or
    for jagging the wound: the same toothings appear in another weapon
    (<i>b</i> fig. 249), which is supposed to be a dagger. No. 446 is a short
    two-edged <span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>blade showing at the shoulders, on either side, four large
    flat head-pins of gold. A gold plate extends all along the middle part
    of the blade on both sides, and fragments of the wooden sheath are
    visible in the middle as well as at the end.</p>

  <p>We now come to the most startling part of the collection. It proves
    indubitably, if Dr. Schliemann’s conclusions be correct, and if the
    blades<a id="FNanchor_816" href="#Footnote_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a> do not belong, as they may do, to a later date, that the
    highest form of Sword, which became the fashion during our sixteenth
    century, was known in <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 1200. It is a curious comment upon
    the fact, how soon perfection was reached in the ‘White Arm,’ compared
    with the slow progress of firearms, which had to await the invention of
    the self-igniting cartridge. Plate No. 445 (p. 281) gives a two-edged
    blade with a mid-rib, in fact the rapier, which can be used only for
    the point. It measures two feet seven inches (<i>a</i> fig. 250), and at the
    top are attached remnants of its wooden scabbard. The lower end of its
    neighbour (<i>b</i> fig. 250) is adorned with three flat golden pin-heads
    on either face. No. 448, measuring two feet ten inches long, is very
    well preserved; by its side lies its alabaster pommel (fig. 249). No.
    449 has retained part of its heft, which is gold-plated and attached by
    gold pins. Vertical lines of intaglio work run along the blade and give
    it a truly beautiful aspect.</p>

  <p>Dr. Schliemann (p. 283) notices the length, in some cases exceeding
    three feet, compared with the narrowness of these grand blades. He
    adds, ‘So far as I know, Swords of this shape have never been found
    before.’ I would refer him to the Villanova (Etruscan) blade described
    in <a href="#CHAPTER_VIII" title="Go to chapter 8">chapter viii</a>.</p>

  <p>The fourth Sepulchre also yielded three shoulder-belts of gold. No. 354
    measures four feet one and a half inch long by one and seven-eighths
    inch in width (fig. 241). On either side of the band is a narrow
    edging made by turning down the gold plate: the field is occupied by
    a row of rosettes, six oval petals surrounding a central disk and the
    whole encircled by dots or points. At one end are two apertures in the
    shape of hour-glasses; these served to attach the clasp to the other
    extremity, as is shown by the small hole and two cuts (p. 308). The
    second ‘Telamon,’ a plain band four feet six inches long by two to two
    and one-third <span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>inches broad, was, the discoverer suggests, possibly
    made for the funeral: it is too thin and fragile for general wear. To
    some blades were still attached particles of well-woven linen, which
    the discoverer considers to have been sheaths (p. 283). The natives of
    India and of other hot-damp regions retain, I have said, the custom of
    bandaging their blades with greased rags. We are also shown (p. 304) a
    gold tassel probably suspended to a belt of embroidered work.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The first of the tomb-stones found in the Acropolis above the
    sepulchres (p. 52) shows (very imperfectly) a hunter standing in a
    one-horse chariot: he grips in his right a long broadsword. The second
    tomb-stone (p. 81) has a naked warrior, who holds the horse’s head
    with his right, and raises in his left a double-edged blade (fig.
    251): Dr. Schliemann finds the figure ‘full of anguish’ (p. 84); the
    head is in profile, and the body almost fronts the spectator. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
    huntsman-charioteer holds in his left a sheathed Sword of the long
    dagger type, ending in a large globular pommel. Many such articles
    were found in the tombs, and the author (p. 225) draws attention to
    the size of the ‘knob’ upon the signet ring. Mostly they were of
    wood or alabaster (p. 281) with golden nails, and frequently plated
    with precious metal. I would suggest that the perforated ball of
    polished rock-crystal (No. 307) found in Sepulchre III., and the
    large-mouthed article (No. 308) coloured red and white inside, were
    also Sword-pommels.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The Treasury supplied ‘five unornamental blades of copper or bronze,’
    with rings of the same metal. The large Cyclopean house, which the
    energetic discoverer would identify with the Palace of the Atreidæ,
    yielded a straight, two-edged, thrusting-blade of bronze: the shoulders
    were pierced with four holes, and there are as many in the tang for
    attaching the handle (fig. 252). The heft was of various substances,
    wood, bone, and ivory, amber, rock-crystal, and alabaster, and it
    was often plated with metals, especially the most precious. Of the
    latter, six specimens are given (pp. 270–71), all highly decorated
    with intaglio work of circles and spirals, rope-bands, and shell-like
    quaquaversal flutings.</p>

  <p>The general opinion that Homer ignored soldering<a id="FNanchor_817" href="#Footnote_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a> gives unusual
    interest to a large bronze dagger found in No. III. Sepulchre, six
    mètres and a half below the surface (p. 164). Two blades are well
    soldered together in the middle (fig. 253). The same art appears (p.
    280) in the attachment of two long narrow plates of thick bronze.
    Crickets (<i>cicadæ</i>) and other ornaments were also found of gold worked
    in <i>repoussé</i> and composed of two halves soldered together.</p>

  <p>The goldsmiths of Mycenæ were true artists. They had work in plenty;
    Dr. Schliemann estimates the metallic value of his finds at five
    thousand pounds. An admirable bit of work (p. 251) is the goat
    standing, like that of Assyria and Istria, with gathered legs upon the
    top of a pin.<a id="FNanchor_818" href="#Footnote_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a> Another (No. 365) is the lion-cub, apparently cut
    and tooled. As in modern India, the circles, spirals, and wave-lines
    are excellently executed, and so is the gold-plating upon buttons of
    wood (pp. 258–59). The old Greek city, too, had a peculiar treatment
    of the whorl, which, combining two and even three—either <i>dextrorsum</i>
    or <i>sinistrorsum</i>—about a common centre, and making the lines of at
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>least two continuous, deserves to be called the ‘Mycenæ spiral.’ This
    ornament passes from the gold trinkets and the tomb-stones of the
    Acropolis to the ‘Treasuries’ of much later date.</p>

  <p>An intaglio of gold is especially interesting, because it represents
    a Monomachía or duel. He to the proper right, a tall beardless or
    shaven warrior, without helmet, and clad only in ‘tights’ and ‘shorts,’
    bears the whole weight of his body upon his left leg, extending the
    right, as in a lunge, and is about to plunge his straight and pointed
    dagger-blade into the throat of his bearded foe (p. 174). A signet-ring
    displays a gigantic warrior who has felled one opponent, put to flight
    a second, and is stabbing a third with a short broad straight blade.
    The vanquished man attempts to defend himself with a long Xiphos (p.
    225). Perhaps the subject may be Theseus clearing out the thieves. A
    gold button shows a square formed by four sacrificial chopper-knives of
    Egyptian shape (p. 263, No. 397).</p>

  <p>The characteristics of the Sepulchres are the orientation of the
    remains, the heads lying to the East, and their imperfect cremation.
    The latter is familiar in Hindú-land, although the people hold the
    fire-funeral to be a fire-birth, when the vital principle called ‘soul’
    or ‘spirit’ has been purged of its earthly dross. The regular layers
    of pebbles, which by ventilating the floor would give draught to the
    flames, have also been noticed in ancient Etruria.<a id="FNanchor_819" href="#Footnote_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a> The only
    <i>viaticum</i> or provisions for the dead were unopened oysters: the rest
    was probably burnt. The utensils are jugs and vases of terra cotta
    (plain and painted), copper tripods and cauldrons, urns and kettles,
    and cups and goblets, the latter one- and two-handed. The ornaments, of
    gold and electrum, are foil-work and plates upon wood, beads of glass
    and agate, studs and buttons, crosses and breast-covers, lentoid gems
    and masks, crowns and diadems. The weapons, all of bronze,<a id="FNanchor_820" href="#Footnote_820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a> are
    axes and arrows, lances, knives, daggers, and Sword-blades; while gold
    and alloys are abundant. We may fairly say that iron is absent from the
    Acropolis of Mycenæ as well as from the Burnt City of the Troad. And
    there is a remarkable similarity in the pattern and construction of
    sundry articles, especially the gold tubes with attached spirals.</p>

  <p>Dr. Schliemann’s discoveries have been subjected to much adverse
    criticism.<a id="FNanchor_821" href="#Footnote_821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a> As far as they go, they prove that the warriors of
    Mycenæ used three varieties of Swords—the Xiphos, the Phásganon, and
    the Kopis.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span></p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>THE SWORD IN GREECE.</i></div>

  <p>The <span lang="grc">ξίφος</span> of Mycenæ is the long, straight, rapier-shaped,
    cut-and-thrust (<i lang="la">cæsim et punctim</i>) blade; its only guard is a
    cross-bar, which, like the scabbard, is beautifully ornamented. The
    word Xiphos is still applied in Romaic to a straight Sword opposed to
    Spati (<span lang="el">Σπάτι</span>),<a id="FNanchor_822" href="#Footnote_822" class="fnanchor">[822]</a> the sabre, the broadsword.</p>

  <p>The <span lang="grc">φάσγανον</span> or dirk which Meyrick (Pl. IV. fig. 16), and sometimes
    perhaps the Ancients, confound with the Xiphos, is a straight blade,
    mostly leaf-shaped and showing its descent from the spear. It is
    rarely longer than twenty inches. In Romaic poetry the word is still
    applied to knives and Sword-daggers like the Yataghan. My idea that the
    Phásganon was used for throwing does not derive from the classics, but
    from the similarity of the blade to the Seax and the Scramasax.</p>

  <p>The <span lang="grc">Κοπίς</span>, which Meyrick makes an Argive weapon, and which English
    translators render simply by ‘Sword,’ has been derived by me from the
    Egyptian Khopsh, whose ‘inside cutting curve’ it imitates, merely
    flattening the bend. Writers on hoplology have mostly ignored its
    origin. They follow Xenophon, who speaks of it as being used by the
    Persians and Barbarians; and Polybius, who assigns its use to the
    Persians before the Greeks—apparently an anachronism. They remark that
    on vases it is the weapon of the Giants, not of the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>Gods, and that the
    Amazons wield it against Hercules. Hence Señor Soromenho<a id="FNanchor_823" href="#Footnote_823" class="fnanchor">[823]</a> would
    assign its origin to the Arabs, and Colonel A. Lane-Fox to the Roman
    legionaries. The latter authority, indeed, contends that its form is
    ‘obviously derived from the straight, leaf-shaped, bronze sword, of
    which it is simply a curved variety.’ Here, I think, he reverses the
    process. Specimens of the Kopis are rare; one was found in a tomb, said
    to be Roman, between Madrid and Toledo, and another of the same find is
    in the British Museum.</p>

  <p>The peculiarity of the Kopis is, I have said, its cutting with the
    inner, not the outer curve, and thus suggesting the use of the point
    and the ‘drawing cut’ instead of the sheer cut. This peculiarity
    was inherited from Egypt, and long appeared in Greek blades. It is
    well shown in the fragment of a bronze Kopis-like broadsword from
    the collection of Don Giovanni Bolmarcich, the Arciprete of Cherso:
    the relic was found in the Island of Ossero with an immense variety
    of bronzes, Greek,<a id="FNanchor_824" href="#Footnote_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a> Roman, and prehistoric or proto-historic.
    General Pitt-Rivers has a bronze Sword-blade from Corinth—a very
    fine specimen. The handle has an <span class="helv large"><b>H</b></span> section, the
    pommel measuring two and a quarter inches across, and the grip three
    and a half inches in length. There is no tang; the blade springs
    from the shoulders, which are prominent; the length is twenty-seven
    inches, and the section that of the Toledo rapier. It is, however,
    slightly leaf-shaped. In the Armeria Real of Turin (section Beaumont
    to north-west), two Greek blades are shown in a glass case. One is
    especially interesting. The total length, all being in one piece, is
    three feet and a half; the blade has a mid-rib; there is a straight
    simple cross-bar at the shoulders, and the hilt ends in a crutch, like
    the Hindú antelope-horns and the scroll-hilt of the Danish Swords.</p>

    It reappears in various parts of Africa, as shown by Barth’s Travels
    (chap. ii. 37 &amp;c.). His ‘Danísko,’ which he translates ‘hand-bill,’ is
    used by the people of a highly interesting province—‘Adamáwa.’ The
    general weapon in the neighbourhood is the ‘goliyo’ or bill-hook of
    the Marghi, and the Njiga of the Baghirmi. It is a heavy and clumsy
    ‘Khopsh’ of the boomerang type.<a id="FNanchor_826" href="#Footnote_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a></p>

  <p>The inside edge characterises, to a certain extent, the Albanian

    Nepaulese mountaineers, whose edge swells out to a half-moon.</p>

  <p>The Mycenæ finds do not enlighten us upon the subject of the <span lang="grc">Ἄορ</span>
    and other forms of the Greek Sword. We know nothing of the Thracian
    <span lang="grc">Ῥομφαία</span>, the Rumpia of Gellius (x. 25), which the A. V.<a id="FNanchor_827" href="#Footnote_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a> translates
    ‘Sword.’ Most writers hold it to be a Thracian lance, like the European
    ‘partisan;’ and Smith’s ‘Dictionary of Antiquities’ describes it as a
    long spear resembling the Sarissa, with a Sword-like blade. This comes
    from Livy (xxxi. 39), who tells us that in woodlands the Macedonian
    phalanx was ineffectual on account of its <i lang="la">prælongæ hastæ</i>, and that
    the Rhomphæa of the Thracians was a hindrance for the same reason. But
    in modern Romaic usage it denotes the flammberg (<i>flamberge</i>), or that
    form of the wavy blade which the Church places in the hands of the
    angelic host. It is always carried by ‘Monseigneur Saint Michel, the
    Archangel, the first knight who in the quarrel of God battled with the
    Dragon, the old enemy of mankind, and drove him out of heaven.’<a id="FNanchor_828" href="#Footnote_828" class="fnanchor">[828]</a>
    Mycenæ supplied no specimen of the <span lang="grc">χελιδὼν</span> (<i>gladius Chelidonius</i>), the
    broad blade with a bifurcated swallow-tailed point. It is mentioned
    by Isidore (xviii.) and by Origen (chap. vi.); and I have alluded to
    it in <a href="#CHAPTER_VII" title="Go to chapter 7">Chapter VII</a>. We are unable to specify the shape of the Athenian
    <span lang="grc">Κνήστεις</span> (<i>Knesteis</i>) or the Lacedæmonian <span lang="grc">ξυίναι</span> (<i>Xyinæ</i>), which
    Xenophon calls <span lang="grc">ξυήλαι</span> (<i>Xuelæ</i>). They may have been, to judge from
    their use, thick cut-and-thrust daggers, in fact <i>Coupe-Choux.</i> Nor do
    we know what kind of blade was carried by the Xystophori (<span lang="grc">ξυστοφόροι</span>)
    in addition to the <i>Xyston</i>: the latter was either the footman’s spear
    (<span lang="grc">δόρυ</span>) or the horseman’s lance; in the ‘Iliad,’ as has been seen, it is
    a long pole studded with iron nails.</p>

  <p>According to history, the Greek infantry Sword was a straight two-edged
    blade, rather broad, and of equal width from hilt to point, which was
    of bevelled shape. For cavalry they preferred the sabre or cutting
    weapon.<a id="FNanchor_829" href="#Footnote_829" class="fnanchor">[829]</a> Iphicrates (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 400), when improving arms and
    armour, must have found spear and Sword too short, for he ‘doubled
    the length of the spear and made the Swords also longer’ <span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>(Diod. Sic.
    xv. 144; Corn. Nepos, xi.). Plutarch (in ‘Lycurg.’) tells us that a
    man in the presence of Agesilaus jeered at the Spartan blade, which
    measured only fourteen to fifteen inches long, saying that ‘a juggler
    would think nothing of swallowing it’;<a id="FNanchor_830" href="#Footnote_830" class="fnanchor">[830]</a> whereto the great commander
    replied, ‘Yet our short Swords can pierce our foes.’ And when a bad
    workman complained of his tool, the Spartan suggested with dry heroism,
    ‘You have only to advance a pace.’</p>

  <p>Dodwell<a id="FNanchor_831" href="#Footnote_831" class="fnanchor">[831]</a> relates that an iron blade found in a tomb at Athens was
    two feet five inches long, including its handle of the same metal. Most
    of our museum specimens, both of bronze and iron, are of fair average
    dimensions. That of Mayence measures nineteen and a half inches (<i>a</i>
    fig. 265), and that of the Museum of Artillery thirty-two. The Pella
    blade in the K. Antiquarium, Berlin, is only twenty-one centimètres,
    including four for the heft.</p>

  <p>The Swords called Gallo-Greek,<a id="FNanchor_832" href="#Footnote_832" class="fnanchor">[832]</a> with bronze blades and sheaths
    (figs. 263, etc.), <span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>are of moderate length—twenty-five inches.
    Pausanias<a id="FNanchor_833" href="#Footnote_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a> alludes to perhaps a shorter weapon (<span lang="grc">ταῖς μαχαίραις τῶν
    Γαλατῶν</span>). And we are told that when Manlius invaded Galatia he found
    the Swords were <i>prælongi gladii</i>.<a id="FNanchor_834" href="#Footnote_834" class="fnanchor">[834]</a></p>

  <p>The Greek fashion of carrying the Sword apparently varied with the
    times, and, perhaps, with the length of the weapon: it is easy to draw
    a dagger from the right, but awkward to unsheathe a full-sized blade.
    Some writers make the Greeks carry the weapon on the right, and others
    on the left: Homer seems purposely to leave his description vague,
    e.g.:—</p>

    both huge and strong, and brandishing it he rushes to his death by

    his weapon after Assyrian fashion, ‘where the two belts cross upon his
    breast, both that of the shield and that of the silver-studded Sword.’
    The ‘Parazonium’ dagger, with its metal scabbard, was usually attached
    to the Sword-belt<a id="FNanchor_839" href="#Footnote_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a> on the other side. Shaped like an ox-tongue
    (‘Anelace,’ or <i>Langue-de-bœuf</i>), and measuring twelve to sixteen

  <p>The part played by the Hellenes upon the great stage of the world’s
    history was their development of civil life—of citizenship. As a
    nation, they wanted the life-long practice of arms and training for
    warfare, brought to absolute perfection by the Romans. Their annual
    games, as shown by the Pindaric Odes, were mostly trials of speed and
    agility. They had the Bibasis or gymnastic dance, and, to mention no
    other, the Pyrrhic or Sword-dance, like all ancient and many modern
    peoples; but these mimicries soon became in the cities mere women’s
    work. They wore side-arms at home only during the Panathenaic fêtes,
    where orchestral actions and attitudes were displayed; and they had not
    those military colonies like the Romans, where every man was a soldier
    and every soldier was a veteran. Their <i>gymnasia</i> and <i>palæstræ</i>
    were schools for calisthenics, which the sturdier Italians held in
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>contempt. They were, like the gymnastic-grounds of the Spartan girls,
    mere hot-beds for growing beauty and good breeders; for attaining
    the perfection of form duly to be transmitted. This process, indeed,
    began with the bride, who furnished her nuptial chamber with the
    finest possible models in painting and statuary. Hence every well-bred
    citizen at Athens, every ‘gentleman,’ was expected to be handsome.
    The Beautiful, the Good, and the Holy grew to be almost synonymous.
    Physical man was raised to his highest expression, till he became the
    mythological, ideal god-man. This anthropomorphism found its final
    stage in Phidias; the Parthenon was its expression, and Olympus its
    culmination.<a id="FNanchor_840" href="#Footnote_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a> Since the ancient man-breeding and man-shaping system
    was abandoned, and the race became intimately mixed with foreign blood,
    chiefly Slav and Hebrew, the reverse has become noticeable: a Greek of
    the classical type is now rarely seen.</p>

  <p>Then came the intellectual age of Greece. Already in <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
    450 Protagoras the Sophist, of the Cyrenaic school, had made ‘man the
    measure of all things.’ The individual becomes a duality; as Aristotle
    expresses it, the animal life is one of sensation, the divine life of
    intelligence. And this change of view gradually extinguished the holy
    fire of art.</p>

  <p>The Hellenes, even in their best times, did not pay that attention to
    the use of arms which was a daily practice with the more practical
    Romans. They had no gladiatorial shows, the finest <i lang="fr">salles d’armes</i>
    in the world. The <span lang="grc">ὁπλοδιδακταὶ (ὁπλοδιδασκολοὶ)</span> or army <i lang="fr">maîtres
    d’armes</i>, and professors of the noble arts of offence and defence,
    were not required by law in Lacedæmon. They practised the Sword, as
    we learn from Demosthenes; he compared the Athenians ‘with rustics
    in a fencing school, who after a blow always guard the hit part and
    not before.’<a id="FNanchor_842" href="#Footnote_842" class="fnanchor">[842]</a> Yet they preferred the pentathlum, the pancration,
    and military dancing; the fencing-room was a secondary consideration.
    Indeed, Plato objected to the useless art of Sword-exercise, because
    neither masters nor disciples ever became great soldiers—a stupendous
    Platonic fallacy!<a id="FNanchor_843" href="#Footnote_843" class="fnanchor">[843]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span></p>

  <p>Nor did Hellas greatly prize herself upon mere arms. The soldier at
    Athens and amongst all the Ionian and kindred races occupied, it is
    true, an honourable position; in the four castes<a id="FNanchor_844" href="#Footnote_844" class="fnanchor">[844]</a> he followed
    the priestly, and he preceded the peasants and the mechanics. But
    the Hellene was essentially a citizen—a politician. He chose his
    magistrates and pontiffs, and he could aspire to become one himself.
    He spent his life in the Agora, canvassing laws and constitutions,
    treaties and alliances. His minor delight was gossip, euphuistically
    expressed by ‘hearing new things.’ Hellas soon learned that her <i>forte</i>
    lay in literature, poetry, oratory, and philosophy, in engineering,
    and in the fine arts. She excelled the world in the exquisite rules of
    proportion; in the breadth of idea, and in the clearness and perfection
    of the literary form: these arts she bequeathed as a heritage to
    mankind, who have nowhere and never surpassed her. While the grand old
    Kemites built for eternity, and subjected even size<a id="FNanchor_845" href="#Footnote_845" class="fnanchor">[845]</a> to solidity,
    Hellas elaborated the principle of Beauty and carried it to its very
    acme. Her spoilt children were avid of novelty: they constructed every
    possible system of cosmogony, of astronomy, of geology (except the
    right one); and they ‘paraded their knowledge,’ as Bacon says, ‘with
    fifes and drums.’ Hence their teachers of the Nile Valley told them
    ‘they were ever children’; and hence they excelled their teachers.</p>

  <p>This is not the place to discuss Greek tactics, nor is there anything
    new to say about them: authors are contented with borrowing from the
    treatises of Ælian and Arrian, who lived in the days of Hadrian. I will
    only remind the reader that even during the ‘Iliad’-ages the Greek
    army had its scheme of battle. Nestor advises his warriors to keep
    their ranks in action after the wont of their forbears; and in two
    places<a id="FNanchor_846" href="#Footnote_846" class="fnanchor">[846]</a> we have allusions to a rude phalanx or oblong rectangle of
    civilised Egypt and Khita-land. Xenophon<a id="FNanchor_847" href="#Footnote_847" class="fnanchor">[847]</a> tells us that the army of
    Agesilaus appeared all bronze (<span lang="grc">χαλκὸν</span>) and red (<span lang="grc">φοίνικα</span>); the latter
    survives in our most inappropriate British scarlet. For the heavy-armed
    Hoplite-swordsmen and the light Peltasts, who had apparently no Swords,
    the student will consult any ‘Dictionary of Antiquities.’</p>

  <p>Another unpleasant feature in Greek warfare was its indifference to
    human life, so much regarded by the Romans. The former preserved their
    old barbarous practice of putting to death their war-prisoners; whilst
    even during the first Punic War the latter had a system of exchange
    combined with a money-payment for any number in excess on either side.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span></p>

  <p>Greece rarely appears in arms except in defensive warfare (as against
    the Persians), in civil wars between citizens and citizens, and in
    semi-civil wars, as between the Athenians and the Spartans, the
    Dorians, Ionians, and Æolians. A glance at any of their campaigns—the
    ‘Anabasis,’ for instance—gives us their measure as soldiers; and what
    else can we expect from a race whose typical men were Themistocles
    and Alcibiades? They were too clever by half; too vain, too restless,
    too impulsive (ever ‘shedding tears’), too self-assertive to become
    disciplined men-machines. They were always ready for a revolt, for a
    change of officers; and it must have been a serious thing to command
    them. In this point, perhaps, they are rivalled by the Frenchman, one
    of the best soldiers in Europe, and also one of the most difficult
    to manage. Great captains—Turenne and Napoleon Buonaparte, for
    instance—shot their recalcitrants by the dozen till the survivors
    learned to ‘tremble and obey.’<a id="FNanchor_848" href="#Footnote_848" class="fnanchor">[848]</a> Like the French, too, and the
    Irish, the Greeks had more dash than firmness. They gained victories by
    the vigour and gallantry of their attack, but they did not distinguish
    themselves in a losing game. Here England excels, and hence Marshal
    Bugeaud said, ‘She has the best infantry in the world; happily they are
    not many.’ We must make them so.</p>

  <p>Hellas owed her successes in foreign wars mainly to the barbarous
    condition of her neighbours. The Romans and all the peoples of Asia
    Minor, save her own colonies,<a id="FNanchor_849" href="#Footnote_849" class="fnanchor">[849]</a> were far behind her when, after the
    fashion of the equestrian races of Northern Asia, she had exchanged
    the chariot for the charger;<a id="FNanchor_850" href="#Footnote_850" class="fnanchor">[850]</a> and when she borrowed from Egypt the
    arts of warfare by land and sea, the paraphernalia of the siege, the
    best of arms and armour, and even the redoubtable phalanx. But she
    lost pre-eminence, physical and moral, when the rival races rose to
    be her equals, and even her superiors, in weapons, organisation, and
    discipline. She began with beating, and she ended with being thoroughly
    beaten by, the Romans.</p>

  <p>Greek literature does not abound, like Roman and Hebrew, in perpetual
    allusions to the Sword: it refers more frequently to the spear and
    bow. Yet Athenæus ennobles the end of his curious <i>olla podrida</i> (the
    ‘Deipnosophists’) with some charming lines alluding to the Queen of
    Weapons. The first passage begins with:—</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span></p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">

        <div class="i0">To Athens gave equality.<a id="FNanchor_851" href="#Footnote_851" class="fnanchor">[851]</a></div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">The second is the song of Hybrias the Cretan:—</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">My wealth is here, the sword, the spear, the breast-defending shield,</div>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>And here arises a curious question. Do races, as is generally assumed,
    decline and fall like nations and empires? Does the body politic obey
    the law of the body corporal? Do peoples grow old and feeble and barren
    after their most brilliant periods of gestation? Or rather do they not
    cease to be great, and to bear great men, because their neighbours have
    grown to be greater, and because genius is repressed by unfavourable
    media? I cannot see that Time has greatly changed the peasant of the
    Romagna, the mountaineer of the Peloponnesus, the Persian become a
    Parsi in Bombay, or the modern soldier of the Nile Valley, who, under
    Ibrahim Pasha, defeated the Turks in every pitched battle. But the
    conditions of Italy, Greece, Persia, and Egypt, are now fundamentally
    altered: they are no longer superior to their surroundings; they are
    environed by races stronger than themselves. Hence, perhaps, what is
    popularly called their degeneracy.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>rôle</i> played by pagan Rome on the stage of history was
    twofold—that of conqueror and that of regulator. In obeying man’s
    acquisitive instinct she was compelled to perfect her executive
    instrument, the fighter. To her we owe the words ‘arms’ and ‘army,’
    ‘armour’ and ‘armoury.’<a id="FNanchor_853" href="#Footnote_853" class="fnanchor">[853]</a> As <i>pugna</i> derives from <i>pugnus</i>, the
    fist, so <i>arma</i> and its congeners derive from <i>armus</i>, the arm:
    ‘antiqui humeros cum brachiis armos vocabant,’ says Festus. Well
    knowing that the ‘God of Battles’ favours superiority of weapons as
    much as, and in select cases more than, ‘big battalions,’ she ever
    chose the implements and instruments she found the best; and, following
    her own proverb, she never disdained to take a lesson in arms even from
    the conquered.</p>

  <p>But Rome soon learnt that to make good soldiers she must begin by
    making good citizens. She insisted upon the civilising maxim ‘Cedant
    arma togæ,’ without, however, the invidious precedence which Sallust
    calls ‘those most offensive words of Cicero’</p>

  <p class="noindent">She subordinated the Captain to the Magistrate, and she
    proclaimed to both the absolute Reign of Law. The idea presented itself
    to the Greek mind in the shape of Fate, Anagké, Nemesis: Rome brought
    it down from the vague to the realistic, from the abstract to the
    concrete, from heaven to earth. Thus, while Greece taught mankind the
    novel lessons of ordered liberty, free thought, intellectual culture,
    and patriotic citizenship, Rome, by her reverence for Law, in whose
    sight all men were equal, preached the brotherhood of mankind. Hence
    Christendom ever has been, and is still, governed by a heathen code, by
    that Roman jurisprudence which flowed from the Twelve Tables, like the
    laws of Jewry from the Ten Commandments. Indeed the ‘Fecial College’
    which pronounced upon the obligations <span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>of international war and peace,
    is an institution which might profitably be revived in the modern
    world.<a id="FNanchor_854" href="#Footnote_854" class="fnanchor">[854]</a></p>

  <p>Rome was single-minded in her objective, conquest; and unlike the
    Greeks, from whom she borrowed, she was not diverted by art or
    literature. All her poets for a thousand years fit into one volume.
    All her art, indeed, can hardly be said to exist; history is silent
    concerning any save a few exceptional Roman architects. Varro laughs
    at the puppets and effigies of the gods. The triumph of Metellus
    (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 146) introduced Art, but the Helleno-Roman artist
    contented himself with copies and with portrait-statues of the great.
    In the days of their highest luxury and refinement, the toga’d people
    were connoisseurs and purchasers who diffused instead of adding to
    knowledge. Others, as Virgil said, might give movement to marble and
    breath to bronze: the Art of the Roman was to rule the nations, to
    spare the subjected, and to debase the proud. ‘Fortia agere Romanum
    est.’</p>

  <p>For the constitution of the Roman army we must consult the estimable
    Polybius,<a id="FNanchor_855" href="#Footnote_855" class="fnanchor">[855]</a> its early historian, Livy, and the latest of the great
    authorities, Vegetius, in the days of Valentinian II. (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span>
    375–92); not forgetting Varro,<a id="FNanchor_856" href="#Footnote_856" class="fnanchor">[856]</a> who treats of weapon changings.</p>

  <p>Whilst the militia consisted of three bodies, the citizens, the allies,
    who were sworn, and the auxiliaries or mercenaries; the characteristic
    of Roman organisation was the Legion—that is, <i>legere</i> (they chose).
    Emerging by slow degrees from the Phalanx or close column,<a id="FNanchor_857" href="#Footnote_857" class="fnanchor">[857]</a> it
    learnt to prefer for battle the <i>acies instructa</i>, haye or line, and
    the <i>acies sinuata</i>, with wings; and it reserved for especial purposes
    the <i>agmen pilatum</i> or close array, and the <i>agmen quadratum</i> or hollow
    square.</p>

  <p>The reason of the change is manifest. The Phalanx or oblong herse was
    irresistible during the compact advance. The wise Egyptian inventors
    made it perfect for the Nile Valley. But it lost virtue in woodlands
    and highlands; it was liable to be broken when changing front, and
    the long unwieldy spears which it required caused confusion on broken
    ground.</p>

  <p>The Legion consisted, strictly speaking, of heavy-armed infantry—of
    Milites, from <i>Mil-es</i>, because reckoned by their thousands. They were
    preceded by the Velites, Ferentarii, or Rorarii, ‘light infantry,’
    <i>éclaireurs</i>, who cleared the way for action; in the first century they
    were reinforced by the Accensi Velati.<a id="FNanchor_858" href="#Footnote_858" class="fnanchor">[858]</a> Whilst the Auxiliaries
    fought with bows and arrows, and some, like the Etruscans, with the
    ‘funda’ or sling, the Veles carried two to seven light throw-spears
    (<i>hastæ <span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>velitariæ</i>) about three feet long in the shaft, with a
    nine-inch lozenge-shaped head of iron.<a id="FNanchor_859" href="#Footnote_859" class="fnanchor">[859]</a> For close quarters he
    wore on his right side a Parazonium-dagger, and on the right a broad
    cut-and-thrust blade of moderate size. His defences were an apron of
    leather strips, studded with metal; and a Parma,<a id="FNanchor_860" href="#Footnote_860" class="fnanchor">[860]</a> the small round
    shield, like the Cetra, some three feet in diameter.<a id="FNanchor_861" href="#Footnote_861" class="fnanchor">[861]</a></p>

  <p>The Legion proper was a line or rather a triple line of Hastarii<a id="FNanchor_862" href="#Footnote_862" class="fnanchor">[862]</a>
    or legionary spearmen. Livy<a id="FNanchor_863" href="#Footnote_863" class="fnanchor">[863]</a> briefly describes the Acies, when
    it emerged from the Phalanx, as ‘drawn up into distinct companies,
    divided into centuries. Each company contained sixty soldiers,<a id="FNanchor_864" href="#Footnote_864" class="fnanchor">[864]</a>
    two centurions, and one ensign or standard-bearer.<a id="FNanchor_865" href="#Footnote_865" class="fnanchor">[865]</a> First in line
    stood the Hastati in fifteen companies with twenty Velites.<a id="FNanchor_866" href="#Footnote_866" class="fnanchor">[866]</a>
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>Behind them were the Principes with heavy shields and complete armour,
    also numbering fifteen companies. These thirty companies were called
    Antepilani, because there were fifteen others placed behind them
    with the standards; each of the latter consisted of three divisions,
    and the first division of each they called a Pilus. The first ensign
    was at the head of the third line proper, the Triarii. Behind them
    stood the Rorarii, whose ability was less by reason of their youth
    and inexperience; and, lastly, in the rear, came the Accensi, a body
    in which little confidence was reposed. The Hastati began the fight,
    and if unable to gain the day, passed to the rear through the ranks
    of the Principes. The latter now marched forwards to action, the
    Hastati following. Meanwhile the Triarii continued kneeling behind
    the Ensigns; the left legs extended to the front, the shields resting
    on the shoulders; the spear-points erect with butts firmly fixed in
    the ground, so that the line bristled as if inclosed by a rampart. If
    the Principes failed, “res ad Triarios rediit.” The Triarii, after
    receiving the Principes and Hastati into their intervals, closed files
    and fell upon the enemy in a compact body.<a id="FNanchor_867" href="#Footnote_867" class="fnanchor">[867]</a> This was the most
    formidable attack, when the enemy, having pursued the vanquished,
    suddenly beheld a new line starting up.’</p>

    <div class="caption smcap">Fig. 272.—Hastatus (from Trajan’s Column).</div>
  </div>

  <p>Thus far Livy. I am tempted by the subject of the Roman legionaries,
    those ‘massive hammers of the whole earth,’ to add, despite its
    triteness, a few details.</p>

  <p>The Hastatus or spearman, a young light-armed soldier, preceded the
    colours; hence he was called Antesignanus. He wore for defence a plain
    or crested helmet which varied with his legion.<a id="FNanchor_868" href="#Footnote_868" class="fnanchor">[868]</a> He had a bronze
    breast-plate thirty-two inches long, or a cuirass of thin metal plates
    defending the chest and forming shoulder-pieces. A kilt<a id="FNanchor_869" href="#Footnote_869" class="fnanchor">[869]</a> of the
    same material protected his lower body; greaves or leggings (<i>ocreæ</i>)
    his legs, and the Scutum or shield his flank. This article (<span lang="grc">σκῦτος</span>,
    leather, dog-skin?), a curved rectangular oblong, larger than the
    Parma, measured about four feet by two and a half feet; the framework
    was of wood, and the covering had a strong boss and metal platings. As
    his name denotes, the Hastatus was armed with the full-sized spear, and
    with a long or short ‘gladius’ or ‘ensis.’ The latter was carried on
    the right, as a rule; as will be seen, it greatly varied in size and
    shape. The soldier, when excited in battle, threw away his spear and
    drew <span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>his Sword; the Etruscans did the same.<a id="FNanchor_870" href="#Footnote_870" class="fnanchor">[870]</a> The shield-umbo was
    also used in close combat to bear down the opponent.</p>

    <div class="caption">Fig. 273.—Centurion’s Cuirass, with Phaleræ or Decorations.</div>
  </div>

  <p>The second line, which like the third followed the standards, was
    composed of the Principes or Proci, soldiers of mature age. The name
    seems to denote that originally they formed the front line, as the
    Greek Promachoi and our Grenadiers.<a id="FNanchor_871" href="#Footnote_871" class="fnanchor">[871]</a> Lastly came the Triarii (third
    line men), a reserve, so called from their position—veterans of tried
    valour who were expected to retrieve the fortunes of the day. At first
    they were the only Pilani<a id="FNanchor_872" href="#Footnote_872" class="fnanchor">[872]</a> (javelineers), as opposed to the two
    first lines (Antepilani). Their redoubtable weapon, which conquered
    so much of the old world, and which descended by inheritance to the
    Franks, was about six feet and three-quarters long, composed of an
    iron (two feet) with oval or pyramidal head, set by a broad tang in a
    wooden socketed shaft treble its length. The latter was round at the
    heel and squared about the shoulders, as we learn from Livy,<a id="FNanchor_873" href="#Footnote_873" class="fnanchor">[873]</a> when
    describing the Phalarica or fire-missile. Both Principes and Triarii
    also carried Swords, the former at the right hip, the latter above
    it: as has before been noticed this is a most complicated subject.
    The bandsmen wore, like the Signa-bearers, a peculiar helmet; they
    consisted of tubicines (using the <i>tuba</i>, a long Etruscan trumpet), of
    cornicines (the <i>cornu</i> being a writhed horn), and of buccinatores,
    blowing a short simple instrument. The Roman officers were armed like
    the men.</p>

  <p>Under the term <i lang="la">utraque militia</i> was included the legionary cavalry
    whose number varied little in proportion to the infantry. In
    Polybius’ day the ratio was two hundred to four thousand. This arm
    was clad in a complete suit of bronze less heavy than the Greeks
    and the Gallo-Greeks;<a id="FNanchor_874" href="#Footnote_874" class="fnanchor">[874]</a> the buckler of ox-hide was round, oval,
    or polygonal. The horseman’s weapons were a Spear (<i>contus</i>), often
    accompanied by a javelin, a waist-dagger, and a Sword worn on the
    right; the latter, unlike ours, preserved the form of the infantry
    weapon. The Greek cavalry in the Roman service at the siege of
    Jerusalem, as we learn from Josephus, carried long Swords suspended to
    the right flank.</p>

  <p>Lastly, the Legion was followed by its massive <i>tormenta</i> (artillery):
    catapults <span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>(for darts) and <i>balistæ</i> (for stones), escorted by the
    <i>vexillarii</i> or oldest soldiers, under their own <i>vexillum</i>, and
    worked by the Sappers or <i>fabri</i> (<i>lignarii</i>, &amp;c.). The camp-followers
    (<i>calones</i>, <i>lixæ</i>) and the baggage (<i>impedimenta</i>) brought up the rear.</p>

  <p>The Roman infantry was carefully drilled. Vegetius tells us that
    recruits were exercised with osier-bucklers and stakes double the
    weight of the normal Swords. There were also regular <i lang="fr">champs de Mars</i>,
    ‘sham-fights’ with wooden Swords and with javelins whose points were
    sheathed in balls.</p>

  <p>In the effeminate days of the Empire, shortly after Constantine,
    military discipline was relaxed, and the decay of the Legion became
    complete. Instead of shouldering their packs the men carried them in
    carts. The Hasta was given up, and the helmet and the cuirass were
    dispensed with as too heavy. Vegetius<a id="FNanchor_875" href="#Footnote_875" class="fnanchor">[875]</a> had reason to ascribe the
    defeat of the Legion by the Goths to the want of its old defensive
    armour.</p>

  <p>It was not only when campaigning that the Romans studied the use of
    arms. In the Campus Martius and the other seven ‘parks’ of the Capital,
    crowds of young men practised riding, swording, and athletics. Another
    mighty <i lang="fr">Salle d’Armes</i> was the Amphitheatre. To a purely military
    nation, gladiatorism had great merits. ‘C’estoit, à la verité,’ says
    Montaigne,<a id="FNanchor_876" href="#Footnote_876" class="fnanchor">[876]</a> ‘un merveilleux exemple, et de tresgrand fruict pour
    l’institution du peuple, de veoir touts les jours en sa presence
    cent, deux cents, voire mille couples d’hommes, armez les uns contre
    les aultres, se hacher en pieces, avecques une si extreme fermeté
    de courage, qu’on ne leur voit lascher une parole de foiblesse ou
    commiseration, jamais tourner le dos, ny faire seulement un mouvement
    lasche pour gauchir au coup de leur adversaire, ains tendre le col à
    son espee, et se presenter au coup.’</p>

  <p>It appears to me that the nineteenth century wastes much fine sentiment
    upon the ‘detestable savagery of the Lanista,’<a id="FNanchor_877" href="#Footnote_877" class="fnanchor">[877]</a> and upon the
    wretches</p>

  <div class="center-container">

  </div>

  <p class="noindent">The <i>ludus gladiatorius</i><a id="FNanchor_878" href="#Footnote_878" class="fnanchor">[878]</a> began as a humane institution
    amongst the Etruscans, who, instead of slaughtering, upon the funeral
    pyre, slaves and war-captives, like Achilles and Pyrrhus, allowed them
    to fight for their lives. The <i>munus</i> at Rome, moreover, was originally
    confined to public funerals, and it was an abuse which allowed it at
    private interments, at entertainments, and at holiday festivals in
    general.</p>

  <p>According to Livy<a id="FNanchor_879" href="#Footnote_879" class="fnanchor">[879]</a> ‘when Scipio exhibited gladiators at Carthage’
    (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 546) ‘they were not slaves or men who sold their
    blood, the usual stuff of the Lanista’s school.’<a id="FNanchor_880" href="#Footnote_880" class="fnanchor">[880]</a> The service was
    voluntary and gratuitous. Combatants were often sent by petty princes
    to show the courage of their people; others came forward <span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>in compliment
    to the General, and some decided their disputes by the Sword. Amongst
    persons of distinction were Corbis and Orsua, cousins-german, who
    determined to fight out their claims to the city called Ibes, and
    they ‘exhibited to the army a most interesting spectacle,’ the elder
    swordsman easily mastering the artless attacks of the younger.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>THE ROMAN GLADIATOR.</i></div>

  <p>Even when the gladiators at Rome were condemned criminals and captives
    whose lives were forfeited by the old laws of war, some humanity
    remained. Although the malefactors doomed <i>ad gladium</i> were to be
    slain within the year, those sent only <i>ad ludum</i> might obtain their
    discharge within three years. And under the Empire to join the shows
    became ‘fashionable:’ Severus was compelled to forbid freeborn
    citizens, knights, senators, and even women from entering the arena.</p>

  <p>The life of the gladiator was one to make the ‘honest poor’ curse
    their lot. He was trained in the best climates, and fed with the most
    succulent food (<i lang="la">sagina gladiatoria</i>): hence Cicero<a id="FNanchor_881" href="#Footnote_881" class="fnanchor">[881]</a> calls rude
    health and good condition ‘<span lang="la">gladiatoria totius corporis firmitas</span>.’ He
    became one of a <i>familia</i> or brotherhood after taking the oath, which
    Montaigne gives from Petronius (117):—‘<span lang="fr">Nous jurons de nous laisser
    enchainer, brusler, battre et tuer de glaive, et de souffrir tout ce
    que les gladiateurs légitimes souffrent de leur maîtres, engageant
    très-religieusement le corps et l’âme à son service.</span>’ In other words,
    he had plenty of society and he was disciplined. Under the Lanista he
    practised daily at the schools, and the <i>ludus matutinus</i> near the
    Cœliolus or little Cœlian Hill was frequented by all classes.<a id="FNanchor_882" href="#Footnote_882" class="fnanchor">[882]</a>
    Here he ‘fought the air’ (<span lang="grc">ἀέρα δέρειν</span>), a <span lang="grc">Σκιαμαχία</span> like our fighting
    the sack; he contended with the <i>rudis</i> (rod or wooden Sword); he cut
    at the Palus, the ‘post-practice’ of German universities and modern
    regiments, and he strengthened back and shoulders with the Halteres
    (dumb-bells, <i>dombelles</i>), and with other artifices. Thus a wound,
    fatal to a man out of training, would only disable one in such splendid
    condition.<a id="FNanchor_883" href="#Footnote_883" class="fnanchor">[883]</a> Pliny,<a id="FNanchor_884" href="#Footnote_884" class="fnanchor">[884]</a> indeed, makes light of his danger. Speaking
    of C. Curio’s two pivot-theatres, which during representations could be
    wheeled inwards or outwards, this model grumbler declares: ‘The safety
    of the gladiators was almost less compromised than that of the Roman
    people, which allowed itself to be thus whirled round from side to
    side.’</p>

  <p>If worsted in combat and sentenced to receive the Sword (<i lang="la">ferrum
    recipere</i>), the gladiator, prepared for his fate, met it with manly
    firmness. When the down-turned thumbs granted mercy, the vanquished
    got his <i>missio</i> or discharge for the day. Augustus humanely abolished
    the barbarity of shows <i>sine missione</i>, where no quarter was given.
    The victor was presented with palms, whence <i lang="la">plurimarum palmarum
    gladiator</i>; and with cash, which doubtless commended him to the other
    sex. We read of old gladiators, showing that the career was not
    necessarily fatal. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>These veterans, and sometimes novices who had
    fought only in a few <i>munera</i>, were, at the request of the people,
    discharged the service by the Editor or Exhibitor of the games. They
    were then presented with a Rudis (<i>rude donati</i>), and, as Rudiarii
    lived happily ever afterwards.</p>

  <p>We have also notices of distinguished gladiators. Diogenes
    Laertius<a id="FNanchor_885" href="#Footnote_885" class="fnanchor">[885]</a> does not disdain to mention as the fourth Epicurus,
    ‘lastly, a gladiator.’ Spartacus, Crixus, and Œnomaus broke out of
    Lentulus’ fencing-school, escaped from Capua, and made a camp at
    Vesuvius; they used the Swords made out of iron plundered in the
    slave-houses to such effect that Athenæus declares, ‘If Spartacus had
    not died in battle, he would have caused no ordinary trouble to our
    countrymen, as Eunus did in Sicily.’<a id="FNanchor_886" href="#Footnote_886" class="fnanchor">[886]</a></p>

  <p>Gladiatorial shows were first exhibited (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 246) in the
    Forum Boarium by Marcus and D. Brutus at their father’s funeral, during
    the Saturnalia (our Christmas) and the Minerva feasts.<a id="FNanchor_887" href="#Footnote_887" class="fnanchor">[887]</a> They were
    abolished by Constantine ‘the Great’ (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 306–33), but the
    edict seemed to give them fresh life; Frank prisoners were slaughtered
    by the hundred in the arena of Trèves. They were finally suppressed
    (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 404) by Honorius, who made a martyr of the monk
    Telemachus. I need hardly relate how this meddling ecclesiastic rushed
    into the amphitheatre to separate the combatants, and was incontinently
    stoned by ‘the house.’</p>

  <p>But the time had come for abolishing these glorious <i>spectacula</i>; as
    mostly happens, long custom and familiarity had merged the use into
    the abuse, and caused Lactantius to exclaim ‘tollenda est nobis!’ The
    misuse had begun under Divus Cæsar, who collected so many gladiators
    for the fights that his enemies became alarmed, and restricted the
    number. Caligula, the ‘Bootling,’ was devoted to the sport, and
    made some gladiators captains of his German guards. He deprived
    the ‘Mirmillones’<a id="FNanchor_888" href="#Footnote_888" class="fnanchor">[888]</a> of certain weapons. One Columbus coming off
    victorious in a fight, but slightly hurt, he caused the wound to be
    infused with poison, which got the name of Columbinum. The nervous
    Claudius (‘Caldius’) assisted at the <i>spectacula</i> ‘muffled up in a
    pallium, a new fashion!’ Having spared, at the intercession of his
    four sons, a conquered prize-fighter, he sent a billet round the house
    reminding the spectators how much it behoved them to get children,
    since these could procure favour and security for a gladiator. In later
    years he became savage. If a combatant chanced to fall, especially one
    of the Retiarii, he ordered him to be butchered that he might enjoy
    the look of the face in the agonies of death. Two combatants happening
    to kill each other, he ordered some little knives to be made of their
    Swords. He also delighted in seeing Bestiarii, and he made the sport
    most brutal and sanguinary. Nero, during his ‘golden quinquennium,’
    ordered that no gladiators, even condemned criminals, should be <span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>slain;
    and he persuaded four hundred senators and six hundred knights, some
    of unbroken fortunes and unblemished fame, to fight in the arena.
    He espoused the cause of the Thraces or Parmularians, and often
    joined in the popular demonstrations in favour of the Prasine or
    ‘green faction,’ without, however, compromising his dignity or doing
    injustice. In his later and crueller days,<a id="FNanchor_889" href="#Footnote_889" class="fnanchor">[889]</a> hearing the master of
    a family of gladiators say that a Thrax was a match for a Mirmillo,
    but not so for the exhibitor of the games, he had him dragged from the
    benches into the arena and exposed to the dogs, with this label, ‘A
    Parmularian guilty of speaking blasphemy.’ And, as ‘Mero’ scandalised
    the world by his passion for singing and harping, so Commodus degraded
    himself by amateur gladiatorship. He was cunning of fence, but in
    the most cowardly way. A powerful man and a practised gymnast, he
    wore impenetrable armour and fought with a heavy Sword, whereas his
    antagonists were allowed only blades of tin and lead. Even the humane
    Trajan<a id="FNanchor_890" href="#Footnote_890" class="fnanchor">[890]</a> exhibited after his victories some ten thousand Dacian
    ‘monomachists.’ The militarism of the Romans, however, made them
    familiar with butchery. Thus Tacitus<a id="FNanchor_891" href="#Footnote_891" class="fnanchor">[891]</a> says: ‘The Germans gratified
    us with the spectacle of a battle in which above sixty thousand men
    were slain.’ This ‘gladiatorial show’ took place near the canal of
    Drusus, where the Roman guard on the Rhine commanded a view of the
    other shore.</p>

  <p>The gladiators used both forms of Swords, the straight two-edged blade
    and the curved.<a id="FNanchor_892" href="#Footnote_892" class="fnanchor">[892]</a> The Dimacheri carried, as the name denotes, two
    weapons: these may have been either two Swords of the same size, as
    carried by the Japanese,<a id="FNanchor_893" href="#Footnote_893" class="fnanchor">[893]</a> or possibly Sword and dagger, a practice
    long preserved on the shores of the Mediterranean. The same may be
    said of the <i lang="la">duos gladios</i> borne by the Gaul whom Torquatus slew.
    The Hoplomachi, armed <i>cap-a-pie</i>, must also have been Swordsmen.
    The Mirmillo<a id="FNanchor_894" href="#Footnote_894" class="fnanchor">[894]</a> was weaponed with a curved blade, cutting inside
    (‘gladio incurvo et falcato’): in Montfaucon, he carries a long convex
    shield and a Sica or short-Sword.<a id="FNanchor_895" href="#Footnote_895" class="fnanchor">[895]</a> Opposed to the Mirmillo was
    the Retiarius, armed with net and trident: Cortez found net-soldiers
    in Mexico, as was natural to fishermen. Winckelmann shows a fight
    between the two: Retiarius has netted his fish and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>proceeds to use the
    <i>fuscina</i> or <i>tridens</i>, while a toga’d Lanista, rod in hand, stands
    behind him and points out where to strike.</p>

  <p>The Samnites were distinguished by the oblong tribal <i>scutum</i><a id="FNanchor_896" href="#Footnote_896" class="fnanchor">[896]</a> and
    the leaf-shaped Greek Sword: so says the Comte de Caylus; but on the
    monument erected by Caracalla to Bato, the weapon is straight up and
    down. The Thræces or Threces (Thracians proper)<a id="FNanchor_897" href="#Footnote_897" class="fnanchor">[897]</a> had round shields,
    and instead of the huge Swords noted by Livy, the short knife called
    by Juvenal <i>falx supina</i>.<a id="FNanchor_898" href="#Footnote_898" class="fnanchor">[898]</a> The Thracian’s Sword closely resembles
    that used in the Isle of Cos. Winckelmann<a id="FNanchor_899" href="#Footnote_899" class="fnanchor">[899]</a> gives a combat between
    two Thracians, each backed up by his Lanista. We find also a naked
    Gladiator, with Sword and shield, fighting another in breast-belt,
    apron (<i>subligaculum</i>), and boots, with a shield and a three-thonged
    <i>flagellum</i> or scourge.</p>

  <p>The Gladiators were an order distinct from the Bestiarii (<span lang="grc">θηριομάχοι</span>)
    who fought against wild beasts; these were exhibited in the Forum,
    those in the Circus. Again, Bestiarii, who can boast that St. Paul once
    belonged to them, must not be confounded with the criminals thrown
    <i>ad leones</i>, without means of defence, like Mentor, Androclus, and
    early Christian communists.<a id="FNanchor_900" href="#Footnote_900" class="fnanchor">[900]</a> The beast-fighters had their <i>scholæ
    bestiarum</i> or <i>bestiariorum</i> where they practised weapons, and they
    received <i>auctoramentum</i> or pay. The arms were various: mostly they are
    shown with a Sword in one hand, a veil in the other, and the left leg
    protected by greaves. Under Divus Cæsar criminals for the first time
    encountered wild beasts with silver weapons. The modern survival is
    the Spanish bull-fight. Gladiatorism lasted in England after a fashion
    till the days of Addison; amongst professional Swordsmen, the highest
    surviving name is that of</p>

  <p>To conclude this discursus on gladiatorism. Most popular sports are
    cruel, but we must not confound, as is often done, cruelty with
    brutality. The former may accompany greatness of intellect, the
    latter is the characteristic of debasement. Every nation is disposed
    to ‘fie-fie’ its neighbour’s favourite diversion. The English
    fox-hunter and pigeon-shooter<a id="FNanchor_902" href="#Footnote_902" class="fnanchor">[902]</a> are severe upon bull-fighting and
    cock-fighting—the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span> classical and Oriental pastime preserved in Spain
    and in Spanish South America.<a id="FNanchor_903" href="#Footnote_903" class="fnanchor">[903]</a> The boxer, who imitates, at a humble
    distance, the Cestus-play of the Greeks and Romans, looks scandalised
    at <i lang="fr">la boxe Française</i>, with its garnishing of <i>savate</i>; and at the
    Brazilian <i>capoeira</i>, who butts with his woolly head. And so <i>vice
    versâ</i>. Absence or presence of fair play should, methinks, condemn
    or justify all the various forms of sport which are not mere or pure
    barbarities. And, applying this test, we shall not harsh judge the
    gladiatorial games of Rome.</p>

  <p>I now proceed to describe the Sword amongst the Romans, a simpler
    subject than in Greece.</p>

  <p>As the so-termed founding of Rome took place during the early Iron
    Age of Southern Europe, it is probable that the citizens, like their
    predecessors the Etruscans, originally made their blades of copper and
    bronze, the leaf-shape being borrowed from the Greeks, as we see it
    retained by the gladiators. The material would last into the Age of
    Steel, but even in her early years Rome must have preferred the harder
    metal. Pliny expressly tells us that Porsena, after his short-lived
    conquest, prohibited the future masters of the world from using iron
    except in agriculture; it was hardly safe to handle a stylus. Polybius
    notes that in his day bronze was entirely restricted to defensive
    armour—helmets, breast-plates, and greaves. All offensive weapons,
    swords and spears, were either made of, or tipped with, steel. To this
    superiority of material we may attribute the Roman successes in the
    second Punic war (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 218–201), and their conquest of the
    gallant Gauls, when their foes could oppose nothing better than bronze.
    They had reason to call a Sword <i>ferrum</i>.<a id="FNanchor_904" href="#Footnote_904" class="fnanchor">[904]</a></p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>THE SWORD IN ROME.</i></div>

  <p>The Romans called the Sword Ensis, Gladius, and Spatha. The two former
    are used as synonyms by Quinctilian,<a id="FNanchor_905" href="#Footnote_905" class="fnanchor">[905]</a> but the first presently
    became poetical. The derivations are eminently unsatisfactory. Voss
    would find Ensis in <span lang="grc">ἔγχος</span>, <i>hasta</i>; Sanskritists in <i>Asi</i>, a Sword, the
    Zend <i>Anh</i>. Gladius is popularly drawn <i>a clade ferenda, quasi cladius</i>
    (Varro and Littleton); Voss prefers <span lang="grc">κλάδον</span> (<i>ramus</i>), a young branch,
    the earliest Sword: to others it appears a congener of the Keltic
    <i>Clad</i>, the destroyer. Of the derivation of ‘Spatha’ I have already
    treated: Suetonius<a id="FNanchor_906" href="#Footnote_906" class="fnanchor">[906]</a> makes it equivalent to Machaira; but this word
    and its diminutive Machærium are loosely used.</p>

  <p>The Roman Sword was, like their other weapons, longer and larger,
    heavier and more formidable than that of the Greeks.<a id="FNanchor_907" href="#Footnote_907" class="fnanchor">[907]</a> The earliest
    form, the ‘hero’s arm’ of Virgil and Livy, was a short single-edged
    cutting weapon of bronze, also called the ‘Gallic Sword,’ because
    long preserved by that people. It is shown in the arm of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>the Roman
    Auxiliary (fig. 276). Another very early, if not the earliest, shape
    was the leaf, which varied in length from nineteen inches (the blade
    found at Mayence) to twenty-six inches (the Bingen find). The latter is
    peculiar; the hilt is ornamented with bronze, and it has a cross-guard.
    Upon another blade (fig. 277), of which a cast is in the Artillery
    Museum, Paris, appears the armourer’s mark, <i>Sabini</i> (<i>opus</i>).</p>

  <p>The third form, which is most generally identified with the Roman
    soldier, greatly resembles that which was introduced into the French
    army by, not without financial benefit to, Marshal Soult. The average
    length may be assumed at twenty-two inches, with a grip of six inches
    and a cross-bar (not always present) four inches and a half long and
    four lines thick. Some specimens show a distinct hilt-plate (fig.
    274, 2). A mid-rib ran along the blade, which was either straight or
    slightly narrowing, and it ended in the bevelled point (<i lang="fr">langue de
    carpe</i>).<a id="FNanchor_909" href="#Footnote_909" class="fnanchor">[909]</a> This thick heavy blade, used <i lang="la">cæsim et punctim</i>, was
    most efficient for hand-to-hand work, and the Roman soon mastered the
    truth, unknown to most Orientals, that ‘the cut wounds and the thrust
    kills.’<a id="FNanchor_910" href="#Footnote_910" class="fnanchor">[910]</a> Accordingly they soon learned to despise the old Sword,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>short and crooked. The national weapon must have been used by Æmilius
    at the Battle of Telamon (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 225), for Polybius notes that
    the Roman blade could not only deliver thrust but give the cut with
    good effect.</p>

  <p>Shortly after that fight the Romans, during their earliest invasions
    of the Spanish Peninsula (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 219), intended to subvert
    Carthaginian rule, adopted the Gladius Hispanus, including the <i>pugio</i>
    (fig. 280); and the change from bronze to steel became universal after
    the battle of Cannæ. The superior material aided them not a little
    in conquering their obstinate rivals. The Roman Proconsul M. Fulvius
    captured (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 192) Toledo (<span lang="grc">Τώλητον</span>), Toletum, ‘a small city,
    but strong in position;’<a id="FNanchor_911" href="#Footnote_911" class="fnanchor">[911]</a> and the superior temper of the steel,
    attributed with truth, I believe, to the Tagus-water, recommended it to
    the conquerors. A later conquest of the Regnum Noricum<a id="FNanchor_912" href="#Footnote_912" class="fnanchor">[912]</a> (Styria,
    <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 16) gave them mines of equal excellence. From Pliny and
    Diodorus Siculus<a id="FNanchor_913" href="#Footnote_913" class="fnanchor">[913]</a> we know perfectly how the Celtiberians prepared
    their iron ores. Of this material was made the Spatha<a id="FNanchor_914" href="#Footnote_914" class="fnanchor">[914]</a> or Iberian
    blade, a name adopted under the Empire, especially under Hadrian
    (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 117–138). Long, two-edged, and heavier than the short
    Xiphos-Gladius, it added fresh force to the <i lang="la">impetus gladiorum</i>.</p>

  <p>In Cicero’s time the Sword must have been of full length to explain
    the joke against his son-in-law; and Macrobius expressly tells us that
    Lentulus was wearing a blade which justified the ‘chaff.’ During the
    days of Theodosius (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 378–394), the straight and strong
    weapon of Hadrian’s time again shortened till it was <span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>not twice the
    size of the hilt; in fact it became a ‘Parazonium.’ The General’s Sword
    (says Meyrick) was called Cinctorium, because carried at the girdle
    that surrounded the lorica, just above the hips; ‘it greatly resembled
    the Lacedæmonian Sword.’</p>

  <p>The Parazonium, <i>pugio</i><a id="FNanchor_915" href="#Footnote_915" class="fnanchor">[915]</a> or dagger, accompanied the Gladius under
    the later Empire, and was carried in the same, or in another, belt,
    generally on the opposite flank. It is the Greek <span lang="grc">ἐγχειρίδιον</span>, and we
    have seen its origin in Egypt. The metal was successively pure copper,
    bronze and steel. The shape of this two-edged stiletto is either
    lanceolate (fig. 280 <i>b</i>),<a id="FNanchor_916" href="#Footnote_916" class="fnanchor">[916]</a> showing its descent from the spear,
    or the straight lines converge to a point (<i>ibid.</i> <i>a</i>). It has a
    notable resemblance to the daggers found in Egyptian tombs (<i>ibid.</i>
    <i>c</i>), and the weapon with the Z-section, still used in the Caucasus
    and in Persia.<a id="FNanchor_917" href="#Footnote_917" class="fnanchor">[917]</a> The tang is usually fitted to receive a wooden
    plate on either side: a favourite substance was the heart of the Syrian
    <i>terebinth</i> (the ‘oak’ of Mamre).</p>

  </div>

  <p>The bronze hilt of the Gladius was retained long after the blade was
    made of steel. The common grip was of wood set with metal knobs or
    rivets; the richer sorts were of bone and ivory, amber and alabaster,
    silver and gold. The heft ended in a <i>capulus</i>; this metal pommel<a id="FNanchor_918" href="#Footnote_918" class="fnanchor">[918]</a>
    was, in its simplest state, a plain mound or a stepped pyramid. But
    presently the ‘little apple’ became the seat of decoration;<a id="FNanchor_919" href="#Footnote_919" class="fnanchor">[919]</a> Pliny
    moans over it, and Claudian speaks of <i lang="la">capulis radiantibus enses</i>.
    This fashion lasted deep into the Middle Ages. The haft was often
    capped with the head of some animal after Assyrian fashion, and that
    of the eagle recurved was a favourite in Rome. In the Armeria Reale
    (Turin)<a id="FNanchor_920" href="#Footnote_920" class="fnanchor">[920]</a> there is a fine Roman chopper-blade with a peculiar
    handle, and a ram’s head for hilt. The handle was usually without
    guard-plate, and at most it had only a simple cross-bar or a small
    oval.<a id="FNanchor_921" href="#Footnote_921" class="fnanchor">[921]</a></p>

  <p>The original <i>vagina</i> (sheath) was of leather or wood, ending in
    a <i>fibula</i> or half-moon-shaped ferule of metal. Some scabbards on
    the monuments, where the Sword, like the helmet and the <i>pilum</i>, is
    conventionally treated, show the scabbard with three opposing rings
    on either side; and, as the belt had only one or two, it is not easy
    to explain the use of the other five.<a id="FNanchor_922" href="#Footnote_922" class="fnanchor">[922]</a> In the luxurious days of
    the Empire, the sheath, like the heft, the pommel, and the ferule, was
    made of gold <span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>and silver reliefs, <i>repoussée</i>-work, and incrustations
    of precious stones disposed upon every part, made it a <i lang="fr">chef-d’œuvre</i>
    of art. Such is the ‘Sword,’ or rather ‘Parazonium, of Tiberius’ dug
    up at Mayence in 1848, and now in the British Museum. The scabbard,
    the mouth, the rings on either side, and the ferule are strengthened
    and beautified by reliefs in gold and silver, and the central field
    bears the portrait of the beautiful ‘Biberius.’ Another Parazonium
    (Anglo-Rom. Coll.) has an iron blade and a bronze scabbard.</p>

    <div class="caption">Fig. 282.—Sword of Tiberius.</div>
  </div>

  <p>A reform of this over-luxury ensued under Constantius II.
    (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 350), and under the noble and glorious Julian<a id="FNanchor_923" href="#Footnote_923" class="fnanchor">[923]</a> ‘the
    Apostate.’ The latter took a lesson from the Eastern Persian, Parthian,
    and Sarmatian (Slav?); moreover, he adopted the iron face-guard known
    at Nineveh, and the mail-coat found upon the Trajan column. These
    revivals and improvements extended deep into the Age of Chivalry.</p>

  <p>The Sword was carried in the <i>balteus</i>, an Etruscan word applied
    indifferently, it would appear, to the bauldric (<span lang="grc">τελαμών</span>), or to the
    waist-‘belt’ (<span lang="grc">ζώνη or ζωστήρ</span>, <i>cingulum</i>). Both were of cloth or
    leather, either plain or decorated with embroidery, with metal plates,
    splendid and elaborate rings and fibulæ, and buckles and brooches of
    the most precious material. It is generally said that the Gladius, and
    its successor the long cut-and-thrust Spatha, were worn belted to the
    right, as amongst the Persians. The old Ensis, on the other hand, was
    slung to the left, like the Egyptians, Assyrians, Hindús, and other
    ‘barbarians.’<a id="FNanchor_924" href="#Footnote_924" class="fnanchor">[924]</a> The latter fashion enabled the Swordsman to draw
    his weapon safely by passing hand and forearm across his body under
    the shield. He would also in this way grip the hilt with the thumb at
    the back of the blade, where it should ever be held, especially when
    delivering the cut. I believe, however, that the Sword was worn by the
    Romans, as amongst the Greeks, on either flank.<a id="FNanchor_925" href="#Footnote_925" class="fnanchor">[925]</a></p>

  <p>We have no knowledge, except from books, of Roman fancy-Swords. Such,
    for example, was the <i>Cluden</i> or juggler’s ‘shutting’-Sword, which ran
    up into the hilt. ‘So great is your fear of steel,’ says Apuleius in
    his defence, ‘that you are afraid to dance with the “close-Sword.”’</p>

  <p>Roman blades of iron are not often found, and yet they must have been
    made by the million. Captain Grose<a id="FNanchor_926" href="#Footnote_926" class="fnanchor">[926]</a> figures a leaf-shaped blade,
    like that of the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>modern Somal, taken from the Severn near Gloucester.
    Meyrick tells us<a id="FNanchor_927" href="#Footnote_927" class="fnanchor">[927]</a> that Woodchester produced an iron Sword-blade
    resembling a large and broad knife (the oldest form of Gladius?) and a
    dagger (<i>pugio</i>), nearly one foot long, and much resembling the modern
    French bayonet. He mentions another iron Gladius nineteen and a half
    inches long, with a fibula of brass. Rev. T. Douglas, in his ‘Nænia
    Britannica’<a id="FNanchor_928" href="#Footnote_928" class="fnanchor">[928]</a> shows the find in a Kentish barrow. The Sword measures
    thirty-five and a quarter inches from pommel to point; the iron blade,
    thirty inches by two inches broad, is flat and two-edged. The wooden
    grip had decayed; the scabbard was of wood covered with leather and
    the weapon hung by a leather strap to the left side. Excavations at
    South Shields produced, says the Rev. J. Collingwood Bruce,<a id="FNanchor_929" href="#Footnote_929" class="fnanchor">[929]</a> five
    Roman Swords, two to three feet long, with wooden scabbards and bronze
    crampets or ferules.</p>

  <p>If Greece produced the golden youth of European civilisation, Rome
    bore the men of antiquity. She taught by example and precept the
    eternal lesson of individual and national dignity, of law and justice,
    and of absolute toleration in religious matters. She had no fear
    of growing great, and scruples about ‘territorial aggrandisement’
    were absolutely unknown to her. The <i>quondam</i> Masters of the World
    effected their marvels of conquest and colonisation with these arts,
    urged by a forceful will, a will so single-viewed and so persistent
    that it levelled every obstacle. A similar gift of determination and
    perseverance made the Turks and Turcomans of a former generation, mere
    barbarians on horseback, bear down all opposition: hence the Arab still
    says: ‘Mount your blood mare and the Osmanli shall catch you on his
    lame ass!’ In virtue of an equal obstinacy, the Kelto-Scandinavian (I
    will not call him an ‘Anglo-Saxon’), the modern Englishman, has trod
    worthily in the footsteps of the old Italian, and from his ‘angle of
    the world,’ his scrap of bleak inclement island, has extended his sway
    far beyond the orb known to his Cæsars. May he only remember the word
    ‘Forwards!’ and take to heart the fact that to stand still is to fall
    back.</p>

  <p>The Roman of the Republic was incomparably the first soldier of his
    age; and he equalled the best of the moderns in discipline, in loyalty
    to his loaders, and in enduring privations, hardship, and fatigue.
    But a glance at any of his campaigns—the famous ‘Commentaries’
    suffice—shows how completely dependent he was upon the quality of his
    commander. Handled by second- and third-rate men, such as generals
    mostly have been, are, and will be, he was ignobly defeated, in
    his most glorious days, by the barbarous Gauls of Brennus; by the
    half-servile hordes of Hannibal; by the degenerate Greeks of Pyrrhus
    with their ‘huge earth-shaking beasts,’ and by the armed mob which
    the Cheruscan Arminius (Ormin or Hermann) led against the incompetent
    Varus. His campaigns, invariably successful in the end, were marked
    by many reverses; and in cases of sudden and sinister emergencies <span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>he
    was too often scared and put to flight. In fact, he could not fight a
    ‘soldier’s battle’; nor has any race done this effectively in modern
    days except the English and the Slavs.</p>

  <p>But when following military genius, the Roman soldier performed
    prodigies of gallantry and valour. A Julius Cæsar, a conqueror in fifty
    pitched battles, whose practice was to order <i>venite</i> not <i>ite!</i> whose
    military instinct could cry at the spur of the moment in the Pharsalian
    fight, <i lang="la">faciem feri, miles!</i> and who could reduce mutineers to reason
    by one word, <i>Quirites!</i> never failed to point the way to victory.
    We learn from the Great Epileptic<a id="FNanchor_930" href="#Footnote_930" class="fnanchor">[930]</a> himself the secret of his
    unexampled success; the care with which he cultivated the individual.
    ‘He instructed the soldiers (when exposed to a new mode of attack), not
    like the general of a veteran army which had been victorious in so many
    battles, but like a Lanista training his gladiators. He taught them
    with what foot they must advance or retire; when they were to oppose
    and make good their ground; when to counterfeit an attack; at what
    place and in what manner to launch their javelins.’<a id="FNanchor_931" href="#Footnote_931" class="fnanchor">[931]</a></p>

  <p>His very arrogance was effective in making him a ruler of men, as when
    on receiving bad tidings he struck his Sword-hilt, saying, ‘This will
    give me my rights!’ And of his ‘politiké’ (as the Greeks call it) we
    may judge by what Polyænus<a id="FNanchor_932" href="#Footnote_932" class="fnanchor">[932]</a> tells us of him. ‘The Romans had been
    taught by their commanders that a soldier should not be decorated with
    gold or silver, but place his confidence in his Sword,’ says Livy.<a id="FNanchor_933" href="#Footnote_933" class="fnanchor">[933]</a>
    But Divus Cæsar encouraged his men to decorate their weapons with all
    manner of valuables for a truly soldier-like reason, that they might
    be the less ready to part with their property in flight. And though he
    plundered freely and rifled even the fanes of the gods, according to
    Suetonius, he was careful, like a certain modern Condottiere, to see
    that his men were well fed and regularly paid by means of the ‘loot.’</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>THE ROMAN SOLDIER.</i></div>

  <p>The Roman soldier had another valuable gift, which has not wholly left
    the Latin race. He knew the ‘magic of patience,’ and was aware that
    ‘le monde est <span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>la maison du plus fort.’ So in the Napoleonic days the
    Spaniards believed chiefly in General ‘No Importa’ (no matter), and
    made little of defeat, hoping it might lead to victory. Nor did the
    Roman soldier degenerate till the citizen set him the example. Velleius
    Paterculus dated the decline of Roman virtue after the destruction of
    Carthage, when civil disputes were decided by the Sword; others to
    the invasion of luxury with Lucullus. Yet Pliny could boast of his
    fellow-countrymen: ‘They have doubtless surpassed every other nation in
    the display of valour.’</p>

  <p>But the Roman soldier generally prevailed against races whom he
    excelled in size, weight, and muscular strength. His superiority in
    arms, like that of the Greek, was not conspicuous when he came into
    contact with the ‘barbarians,’<a id="FNanchor_934" href="#Footnote_934" class="fnanchor">[934]</a> especially with the northern
    barbarians, after they had learned the moral training and confidence
    of discipline and the practical art of war, as well as, if not better
    than, himself. For the man of the higher European latitudes has ever
    surpassed the Southron in strength of constitution, in stature, in
    weight, in muscular power, and in the mysterious something called
    vitality. Hence it is a rule in anthropology that the North beats the
    South; in the Southern hemisphere the reverse being the case, as we see
    in the wars of the Hispano-American republics, Chili <i>versus</i> Peru. In
    Europe I need only point out that the Northmen of Scandinavia conquered
    Normandy and that Norman-French conquered England. The only exceptions
    are easily explained. The genius of Divus Cæsar made his Romans
    overcome, overrun, and subjugate Gaul. Napoleon the Great found the
    road <i>à Berlin</i> open and easy. But intellectual monsters like these two
    are the rare produce of Time; and human nature requires a long period
    of rest before repeating such portents.</p>

  <p>Those who read history without prepossessions and prejudices are
    compelled to conclude that the life and career of a nation are mainly
    determined by its physical size and its muscular strength. We have only
    to learn how many foot-pounds a race can raise and we can forecast its
    so-called ‘destinies.’<a id="FNanchor_935" href="#Footnote_935" class="fnanchor">[935]</a></p>

    </h2>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Most</span> works on Arms and Armour, when treating of Rome, describe the
    weapons of her European neighbours ‘upon whom she sharpened the sword
    of her valour as on a whetstone.’<a id="FNanchor_936" href="#Footnote_936" class="fnanchor">[936]</a> The extent of the subject will
    here confine me to a general glance, beginning with the Dacians on
    the east and ending with the British Islands. I must reserve details
    concerning the Kelts, the Scandinavians, the Slavs, and other northern
    peoples for Part II., to which they chronologically belong.</p>

  <p>The Dacians, especially of Dacia Trajana, Hungary, and Transylvania,
    Moldavia, and Wallachia, are known to us chiefly by the bas-reliefs on
    the Trajan Column. It was built by that emperor, who, like Hadrian,
    followed in the footsteps of Divus Cæsar, to commemorate the conquests
    of <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 103–104; and it dates three years before his death in
    <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 114. The Dacian Sword was somewhat sickle-shaped, with an
    inner edge, like the oldest Greek and its model, the Egyptian Khopsh. A
    Dacian Sword on the trophy belonging to Dr. Gregorutti, of Papiriano,
    is a curved sabre without a cross-bar.</p>

  <p>I have elsewhere noticed the Thracian Sword. Dr. Evans<a id="FNanchor_937" href="#Footnote_937" class="fnanchor">[937]</a> mentions
    the fragment of a remarkable bronze blade from Grecian Thera; it has a
    series of small broad-edged axes of gold, in shape like conventional
    battle-axes, inlaid along the middle between two slightly projecting
    ribs. The same author, speaking of the beautiful bronze Sword in the
    Berlin Museum, reported to have been found at Pella in Macedonia,
    mentions the suspicion that it may belong to the Rhine Valley.<a id="FNanchor_938" href="#Footnote_938" class="fnanchor">[938]</a></p>

  <p>Ancient Illyria has transmitted the Roman Gladius to comparatively
    modern ages. Bosnian tombs of Slavs, Moslem, and Christian, show the
    short straight thrusting Sword, with simple cross-bar and round pommel.
    It looks as if it had been copied from some classical coin.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>THE OLD KELTIC SWORD.</i></div>

  <p>The ancient cemetery at Hallstadt in the Salzkammergut, occupied by the
    Danubian-Keltic Alanni or Norican Taurisci, is especially interesting
    for two reasons. It shows the Bronze Sword synchronous with the Iron,
    and it proves that the change of metal involved little of alteration
    in the form and character of the weapon. This, however, was to be
    expected, as both were adapted for the same purpose—the thrust, not
    the cut. Of the twenty-eight long Swords, six were <span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>of bronze, nineteen
    of iron, and three with bronze hefts and iron blades; there were also
    forty-five short Swords, iron blades with bronze or ivory handles.
    The blade, about one mètre long, is leaf-shaped, two-edged, and
    bevel-pointed. The small and guardless grip of 2·5 centimètres, when
    made of bronze, meets the blade in a hollow crescent, like the British
    Sword in the Tower, and is fastened with metal rivets. The pommel is
    either a cone of metal or a crutch with a whorl ending either arm.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Dr. Evans<a id="FNanchor_939" href="#Footnote_939" class="fnanchor">[939]</a> mentions that in one instance the hilt and pommel of an
    iron Sword are in bronze, in another the pommel alone; the hilt-plate
    of iron being flat and rivetted like the bronzes. In others the pommel
    is wanting. He has a broken iron Sword from this cemetery, the blade
    showing a central rounded rib, with a small bead on either side. Also a
    ‘beautiful bronze Sword from the same locality, on the blade of which
    are two small raised beads on either side of the central rib, and in
    the spaces between them a three-fold wavy line punched in or engraved.
    In this instance a tang has passed through the hilt, and was formed of
    alternate blocks of bronze and of some substance that has perished,
    possibly ivory. A magnificent iron Sword from Hallstadt, now in the
    Vienna Museum, has the hilt and pommel of ivory inlaid with amber.’
    Other grips were of bronze, wood, or bone. The sheaths were mostly
    of wood, which seemed to have been covered with leather. Most of the
    blades were buried without scabbards, and the bronze had been purposely
    broken.</p>

  <p>The forty-five short Swords represent the Ensis Noricus (<span lang="grc">μάχαιρα
    Κέλτικα</span>), and were in use till the Roman days. The iron-blades are
    either leaf-shaped or formed like the peculiarly English anelace or
    anlas, more or less conical and sharp-pointed; and the grip of bronze
    or ivory ended in a simple crutch. Amongst them is a distinct Scramasax
    which may be compared with the late Danish weapon.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span></p>

  <p>Bronze blades are comparatively rare in Italy, although the use was
    long retained and the weapon is often mentioned by Latin writers in
    verse and prose.<a id="FNanchor_940" href="#Footnote_940" class="fnanchor">[940]</a> This seems to decide the question against the
    Roman origin of the North-European Sword: of course it is possible
    that, like the Runic alphabet, they might have been copied from coins;
    but there are other points which militate against this view. Dr. John
    Evans<a id="FNanchor_941" href="#Footnote_941" class="fnanchor">[941]</a> notes a peculiarity which he has often pointed out by word
    of mouth, but which has not as yet been noticed in print. ‘It is, that
    there is generally, though not universally, a proportion between the
    length of the blade and the length of the hilt-plate; long sword blades
    having, as a rule, long hilt-plates, and short sword blades short
    hilt-plates. So closely is this rule of proportion preserved, that the
    outline of a large sword on the scale of one-sixth would in some cases
    absolutely correspond with that of one which was two-thirds of its
    length if drawn on the scale of one-fourth.’ This suggests derivation,
    as if an original <i>modulus</i> of the weapon had appeared in a certain
    racial centre and thence had radiated in all directions. Nor have we
    any difficulty in determining that this centre was the Nile Valley.</p>

  <p>The bronze Swords of Italy present varieties not found in Britain.<a id="FNanchor_942" href="#Footnote_942" class="fnanchor">[942]</a>
    The blade-sides are more nearly parallel, and many have a slender tang
    at the hilt, sometimes with one central rivet-hole, sometimes with two
    rivet-holes forming loops at either side of the ‘spine.’ In others the
    blade slightly narrows for the tang, and each side has two semicircular
    rivet-notches. In many Italian and French Swords the blade is drawn
    out to a long tapering point, so that its edges present a sub-ogival
    curve. On an Italian <i>quincussis</i> or oblong bronze coin, six inches
    and five-eighths by three inches and a half, and weighing about three
    pounds and a half, is the representation of a leaf-shaped Sword with a
    raised rib along the centre of the blade.<a id="FNanchor_943" href="#Footnote_943" class="fnanchor">[943]</a> Upon the reverse appears
    the figure of a scabbard with parallel sides and a nearly circular
    chape. Another coin of the same type, engraved by Carelli,<a id="FNanchor_944" href="#Footnote_944" class="fnanchor">[944]</a> has an
    almost similar scabbard on the reverse, but the Sword on the obverse
    is either sheathed or is not leaf-shaped, the sides being parallel:
    the hilt is also curved, and there is a cross-guard. In fact upon the
    one coin the weapon has the appearance of a Roman Sword of iron, and
    on the other that of a leaf-shaped Sword of bronze. Those pieces, says
    Dr. Evans, were no doubt cast in <span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>Umbria, probably in the third century
    <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, but their attribution to Ariminum is at best doubtful.
    From the two varieties of Sword appearing on coins of the same type,
    the inference may be drawn, either that bronze blades were then being
    superseded in Umbria by iron, or that the original type was some sacred
    weapon, subsequently conventionalised to represent the article in
    ordinary use.</p>

  <p>The iron Swords of the Italian tribes are rarely mentioned, and then
    cursorily. Diodorus Siculus, for instance, tells us (v. 33) that the
    Ligures had blades of ordinary size. They probably adopted the Roman
    shape, which had proved itself so serviceable in the field.</p>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>THE CELTIBERIAN AND OLD SPANISH SWORD.</i></div>

    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 286.—Blade and Handle of Bronze with Part of
      Eagle</span> (Kessel).</div>
  </div>

  <p>Proceeding further westward we find Diodorus Siculus (v. cap. 33)
    dwelling upon the Celtiberian weapons.<a id="FNanchor_945" href="#Footnote_945" class="fnanchor">[945]</a> ‘They had two-edged Swords
    of well-tempered steel; besides their daggers, a span long, to be used
    at close quarters. They make weapons and iron in an admirable manner,
    for they bury their plates so long underground as is necessary to eat
    away the weaker part; and, therefore, they use only that which is firm
    and strong. Swords and other weapons are made of this prepared steel;
    and these are so powerful in cutting, that neither shield nor helm nor
    bone can withstand them.’ Plutarch<a id="FNanchor_946" href="#Footnote_946" class="fnanchor">[946]</a> repeats this description, which
    embodies the still prevalent idea concerning the Damascus (Persian)
    scymitar and the Toledo rapier. Swedenborg<a id="FNanchor_947" href="#Footnote_947" class="fnanchor">[947]</a> introduces burial
    among the different methods of making steel; and Beckmann, following
    Thunberg, declares that the process is still used in Japan.</p>

  <p>General A. Pitt-Rivers’ collection has two Swords from Spain. The
    first is a bronze, sub-leaf-shaped, with a thin protracted point. The
    length is twenty-one inches; the breadth at the swell two inches,
    thinning near the handle to one inch and a quarter; the tang is broken,
    and there are two rivet-holes at the shoulder, which is two inches
    wide. The other, which the owner calls a ‘Kopis,’ also twenty-one
    inches long, and two inches and a half in width, has a broad back and
    a wedge-section. The cutting part is inside, and the whole contour
    remarkably resembles the Kukkri or Korah of Nepaul, and, in a less
    degree, the Albanian Yataghan and the Kabyle ‘Flissa.’ The Kopis,
    however, has a hook-handle as if for suspension; and there is a
    swelling in the inside of the grip.</p>

  <p>‘As the Celtiberians,’ continues Diodorus, ‘are furnished with two
    Swords,’ (probably <i>espada y daga</i>), ‘the horsemen, when they have
    routed their opponents, dismount, and, joining the foot, fight as its
    auxiliaries.’ The Lusitanians, most valiant of the race, inhabited
    a mountain-land peculiarly rich in minerals. Justin<a id="FNanchor_948" href="#Footnote_948" class="fnanchor">[948]</a> speaks of
    the gold, copper, lead, and vermilion, which last named the ‘Minho’
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>river. Of the iron he says: ‘It is of an extraordinary quality, but
    their water is more powerful than the iron itself; for the metal being
    tempered in it becomes keener; nor is any weapon held in esteem among
    them that has not been dipt in the Bilbilis or the Chalybs.’<a id="FNanchor_949" href="#Footnote_949" class="fnanchor">[949]</a>
    Strabo<a id="FNanchor_950" href="#Footnote_950" class="fnanchor">[950]</a> represents Iberia as abounding in metal, and arms the
    Lusitanians with poniard and dagger, probably meaning dirk and knife.</p>

    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 287.—Gallic Sword of Bronze</span> (Jähns).</div>
  </div>

  <p>The Northern neighbours of the Celtiberians—the warlike old
    Keltic<a id="FNanchor_951" href="#Footnote_951" class="fnanchor">[951]</a> Gauls—were essentially swordsmen: they relied mainly upon
    the Claidab.<a id="FNanchor_952" href="#Footnote_952" class="fnanchor">[952]</a> When they entered Europe they had already left behind
    them the Age of Stone; and they made their blades of copper, bronze,
    and iron. The latter, as we learn from history, entered into use during
    the fourth or fifth century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, the later Celtic Period,
    as it is called by Mr. Franks. The material appears to have been,
    according to all authorities, very poor and mean. The blade was mostly
    two-edged, about one mètre long, thin, straight, and without point
    (<i lang="la">sine mucrone</i>); it had a tang for the attachment of the grip, but no
    guard or defence for the hand.</p>

  <p>Yet their gallantry enabled the Gauls to do good work with these bad
    tools. F. Camillus, the dictator,<a id="FNanchor_953" href="#Footnote_953" class="fnanchor">[953]</a> seeing that his enemy cut mostly
    at head and shoulders, made his Romans wear light helmets, whereby the
    Machairæ-blades were bent, blunted, or broken. Also, the Roman shield
    being of wood, he ‘directed it for the same reason to be bordered with
    a thin plate of brass’ (copper, bronze?). He also taught his men to
    handle long pikes, which they could thrust under the enemy’s weapons.
    Dionysius Halicarnassus introduces him saying, while he compares Roman
    and Gaulish arms, that these Kelts assail the foe only with long
    lances and large knives (<span lang="grc">μάχαιρας κοπίδες</span>)<a id="FNanchor_954" href="#Footnote_954" class="fnanchor">[954]</a> <span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>of sabre shape (?).
    This was shortly before his defeating and destroying Brennus and the
    Senonian<a id="FNanchor_955" href="#Footnote_955" class="fnanchor">[955]</a> Gauls, who had worsted the Romans (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 390) on
    the fatal <i>dies Alliensis</i>,<a id="FNanchor_956" href="#Footnote_956" class="fnanchor">[956]</a> and who had captured all the capital
    save the Capitol.</p>

  <p>The Gauls of Cæsar’s day<a id="FNanchor_957" href="#Footnote_957" class="fnanchor">[957]</a> had large iron mines which they worked
    by tunnelling; their ship-bolts were of the same material, and they
    made even chain-cables of iron. They had by no means, however,
    abandoned the use of bronze arms. Pausanias<a id="FNanchor_958" href="#Footnote_958" class="fnanchor">[958]</a> also speaks of
    <span lang="grc">ταῖς μαχαίραις τῶν Γαλατῶν</span>. Diodorus<a id="FNanchor_959" href="#Footnote_959" class="fnanchor">[959]</a> notes that the Kelts wore
    ‘instead of short straight Swords (<span lang="grc">ξίφους</span>), long broad blades (<span lang="grc">μάκρας
    σπάθας</span><a id="FNanchor_960" href="#Footnote_960" class="fnanchor">[960]</a>), which they bore obliquely at the right side hung by iron
    and copper chains.... Their Swords are not smaller than the Saunions
    (<span lang="grc">σαυνίων</span><a id="FNanchor_961" href="#Footnote_961" class="fnanchor">[961]</a>) of other nations, and the points of their Saunions are
    bigger than those of their Swords.’ Strabo<a id="FNanchor_962" href="#Footnote_962" class="fnanchor">[962]</a> also makes the Gauls
    wear their long Swords hanging to the right. Procopius,<a id="FNanchor_963" href="#Footnote_963" class="fnanchor">[963]</a> on the
    other hand, notices that the Gallic auxiliaries of Rome wore the Sword
    on the left.<a id="FNanchor_964" href="#Footnote_964" class="fnanchor">[964]</a> According to Poseidonius,<a id="FNanchor_965" href="#Footnote_965" class="fnanchor">[965]</a> the Gauls also carried
    a dagger which served the purpose of a knife, and this may have caused
    some confusion in the descriptions.</p>

  <p>Q. Claudius Quadrigarius in Aulus Gellius,<a id="FNanchor_966" href="#Footnote_966" class="fnanchor">[966]</a> noticing the
    ‘monomachy’ of Manlius Torquatus with the Gaul, declares that the
    latter was armed with two gladii. Livy describes the same duel in
    his best style. The Roman, of middling stature and unostentatious
    bearing, takes a footman’s shield and girds on a Spanish Spatha—arms
    fit for ready use rather than show. The big Gaul, another Goliah,
    glittering in a vest of many colours, and in armour stained and inlaid
    with gold, shows barbarous exultation, and thrusts out his tongue in
    childish mockery. The friends retire and leave the two in the middle
    space, ‘more after the manner of a theatrical show than according
    to the law of combat.’ The enormous Northerner, like a huge mass
    threatening to crush what was beneath it, stretched forth his shield
    with his left hand and planted an ineffectual cut of the Sword with
    loud noise upon the armour of the advancing foe. The Southron, raising
    his <span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>Sword-point, after pushing aside the lower part of the enemy’s
    shield with his own, closed in, insinuating his whole body between
    the trunk and arms of his adversary, and by two thrusts, delivered
    almost simultaneously at belly and groin, threw his opponent, who when
    prostrate covered a vast extent of ground. The gallant victor offered
    no indignity to the corpse beyond despoiling it of the <i>torques</i>,
    which, though smeared with blood, he cast around his neck.</p>

  <p>Polybius,<a id="FNanchor_967" href="#Footnote_967" class="fnanchor">[967]</a> recounting the battle at Pisæ, where Aneroestes, king
    of the Gæsatæ,<a id="FNanchor_968" href="#Footnote_968" class="fnanchor">[968]</a> aided by the Boii, the Insubres, and the Taurisci
    (Noricans, Styrians), was defeated by C. Atilius (<span class="smcap">a.u.c.</span> 529
    = <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 225), shows the superiority of the Roman weapons.
    He describes the Machairæ of the Gauls ‘as merely cutting blades
    ... altogether pointless, and fit only to slash from a distance
    downwards: these weapons by their construction soon wax blunt, and
    are bent and bowed; so that a second blow cannot be delivered until
    they are straightened by the foot.’ The same excellent author,<a id="FNanchor_969" href="#Footnote_969" class="fnanchor">[969]</a>
    when describing the battle of Cannæ (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 216), tells us that
    Hannibal and his Africans were armed like Romans, with the spoils of
    the preceding actions; while the Spanish and Gaulish auxiliaries had
    the same kind of shield, but their Swords were wholly unequal and
    dissimilar. While the Spanish Xiphos was excellent both for cutting and
    thrusting, the long and pointless Gallic Machæra could only slash from
    afar. Livy<a id="FNanchor_970" href="#Footnote_970" class="fnanchor">[970]</a> also notices the want of point and the bending of the
    soft and ill-tempered Keltic blades.</p>

  <p>When Lucius Manlius attacked the Gauls, <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 181, the latter
    carried long flat shields, too narrow to protect the body.<a id="FNanchor_971" href="#Footnote_971" class="fnanchor">[971]</a> They
    were soon left without other weapons but their Swords, and these
    they had no opportunity of using, as the enemy did not come to close
    quarters. Phrensied with the smart of missiles raining upon their
    large persons, the wounds appearing the more terrible from the black
    blood contrasting with the white skin; and furious with shame at being
    put <i lang="fr">hors de combat</i> by hurts apparently so small, they lost many by
    the Swords of the Velites. These ‘light bobs’ in those days were well
    armed; they had shields three feet long, <i>pila</i> for skirmishing, and
    the <i>Gladius Hispanus</i>, which they drew after shifting the javelins to
    the left hand. With these handy blades they rushed in and wounded faces
    and breasts, whilst the Gallic Swords could not be wielded without
    space.</p>

  <p>Passing from books to monuments, we see on an Urban medal of Rimini,
    dating from the domination of the Senones, a long-haired and
    moustachio’d Gaul, and on the reverse a broad Spatha, with scabbard and
    chain. This is repeated on another coin of the same series, where a
    naked Gaul, protected by an oblong shield, assails <span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>with the same kind
    of Sword. A third shows the Gaul with two <i>gladii</i>, one shorter than
    the other.<a id="FNanchor_972" href="#Footnote_972" class="fnanchor">[972]</a> The scabbards and chains were of bronze or iron.</p>

  <p>According to Diodorus,<a id="FNanchor_973" href="#Footnote_973" class="fnanchor">[973]</a> the Gauls advanced to battle in
    war-chariots (<i>carpentum</i>, <i>covinus</i>, <i>essedum</i>). They also had
    cavalry;<a id="FNanchor_974" href="#Footnote_974" class="fnanchor">[974]</a> but during their invasions of Italy they mostly fought
    on foot. They had various kinds of missiles, javelins, and the Cateia
    or Caia (boomerang, or throwing-club), slings, and bows and arrows,
    poisoned as well as unpoisoned. They then rushed to the attack with
    unhelm’d heads, and their long locks knotted on the head-top. In many
    fights they stripped themselves, probably for bravado, preserving only
    the waistcloth and ornaments, torques, leglets, and armlets. They
    cut off the heads of the fallen foes; slung them to their shields or
    saddlebows, and kept them at home as trophies, still the practice
    of the Dark Continent. Their girls and women fought as bravely as
    the men; especially with the <i>contus</i> or wooden pike, sharpened and
    fire-hardened. The waggons ranged in the rear formed a highly efficient
    ‘lager.’ The large Keltic stature, their terrible war-cries, and their
    long Swords wielded by doughty arms and backed by stout hearts, enabled
    them more than once to triumph over civilised armies.</p>

  <p>Divus Cæsar, who is severe upon Gallic <i>nobilitas</i>, <i>levitas</i>, and
    <i>infirmitas animi</i>, employed nine years in subduing Gaul (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
    59–50). Before a century elapsed, the people had given up their old
    barbarous habits and costume, their fur-coats, like the Slav and
    Afghan <i>postín</i>, with sleeves opening in front; their saga-cloaks or
    tartan-plaids<a id="FNanchor_975" href="#Footnote_975" class="fnanchor">[975]</a> which were probably imitations of the primæval
    tattoo;<a id="FNanchor_976" href="#Footnote_976" class="fnanchor">[976]</a> their copper torques and their rude chains and armlets.
    Gallia Comata shore her limed and flowing locks, and Gallia Bracchata
    (Provincia, Provence) doffed the ‘<i>truis</i>’ (trews or trowsers) which
    were strapped at the waist and tied in at the ankles.<a id="FNanchor_977" href="#Footnote_977" class="fnanchor">[977]</a> Their women
    adopted Roman fashions, and forgot all that Ammianus Marcellinus had
    said of them: ‘A whole troop of foreigners could not withstand a single
    Gaul, if he called to aid his wife, who is usually very strong and
    blue-eyed, especially when, swelling her neck, gnashing her teeth, and
    whirling her sallow arms of enormous bulk, she begins to strike blows,
    mingled with kicks, as if they were so many missiles sent from the
    string of a catapult.’ Of their old and rugged virtue we may judge by
    the tale of Ortiagon’s gallant wife and the caitiff centurion.<a id="FNanchor_978" href="#Footnote_978" class="fnanchor">[978]</a>
    Thus Gaul was thoroughly subdued by <span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>Roman civilisation and the
    Latin tongue; she contributed to literature her quotum of poets and
    rhetoricians; her cities established schools of philosophy, and she saw
    nothing to envy in Gallia Togata—Upper Italy.<a id="FNanchor_979" href="#Footnote_979" class="fnanchor">[979]</a></p>

  <p>The Alemanni or Germans (Germani) cast of the Rhine inhabited, at the
    time of the Roman conquests, a dismal land of swamps and <i>silvæ</i>: even
    in the present day a run from Hamburg to Berlin explains the ancient
    exodus of tribes bent upon conquering the ‘promised lands’ of the
    south, and the modern wholesale emigration to America. These ‘warmen’
    were formerly surpassed by the Gauls in bravery,<a id="FNanchor_980" href="#Footnote_980" class="fnanchor">[980]</a> but they had
    none of the Keltic levity or instability. The national characteristic
    was and is the steadfast purpose. Till lately the German Empire was
    a shadowy tradition; yet the Germans managed to occupy every throne
    in Europe save two. They never yet made a colony, yet cuckoo-like
    they hold the best of those made by others; and their sound physical
    constitution, strengthened by gymnastics, enables them to resist
    tropical and extreme climates better than any European people save the
    Slavs and the Jews. In the great cities of the world they occupy the
    first commercial place, the result of an education carefully adapted to
    its end and object; and their progress in late years seems to promise
    ‘Germanism’ an immense future based upon the ruins of the neo-Latin
    races.</p>

  <p>We have the authority of Tacitus for the fact that the Germans of his
    day did not (like the Kelts)<a id="FNanchor_981" href="#Footnote_981" class="fnanchor">[981]</a> affect the short straight sword:
    ‘rari ... gladiis utuntur.’<a id="FNanchor_982" href="#Footnote_982" class="fnanchor">[982]</a> The national weapon was the spear<a id="FNanchor_983" href="#Footnote_983" class="fnanchor">[983]</a>
    of a peculiar kind; ‘hastas vel ipsorum vocabulo frameas gerunt angusto
    et brevi ferro.’ The derivation of the word and the nature of the
    weapon are still undetermined.<a id="FNanchor_984" href="#Footnote_984" class="fnanchor">[984]</a> Modern authorities hold the oldest
    <i>framée</i> to have been a long spear, with a head of stone, copper,
    bronze, or iron, shaped like a Palstab or an expanding ‘Celt;’ and
    Demmin<a id="FNanchor_985" href="#Footnote_985" class="fnanchor">[985]</a> shows the same broad shovel-shaped base in the Abyssinian
    lance. It was either thrown or thrust, and the weapon must not be
    confounded with the enormous <i>hastæ</i> of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>Tacitus,<a id="FNanchor_986" href="#Footnote_986" class="fnanchor">[986]</a> in whose day the
    Roman spear was fourteen feet long. It was a formidable weapon; those
    who knew it spoke with awe of ‘illam cruentam victricemque frameam’;
    and the Germans long preserved the saying ‘one spear is worth two
    Swords.’ Yet, strange to say, it is rarely found in graves, where the
    throwing-axe of stone and bronze, pierced or unpierced, one-edged or
    two-headed (<span lang="grc">πέλεκυς ἀμφιστόμος</span>, bipennis), is so common.</p>

  </div>

  <p>In time the word <i>framea</i> was apparently applied to wholly different
    weapons. Thus Augustinus makes it an equivalent of <i>spatha</i> or
    <i>rhomphaia</i>; and Johannes de Janua (‘Glossary’) explains it as ‘glaive
    aigu d’une part, et d’autre espée.’</p>

  <p>Iron, according to Tacitus,<a id="FNanchor_987" href="#Footnote_987" class="fnanchor">[987]</a> was known to the Germans, but was not
    common. His statement is supported by ‘finds’ in the old tumuli and
    stone rings, known as Riesenmauer, Hünnenringe,<a id="FNanchor_988" href="#Footnote_988" class="fnanchor">[988]</a> Teufelsgraben,
    Burgwälle, and others. The myths of giants, dwarfs, and serpents
    suggest an Eastern origin for the metal. Bronze blades, on the other
    hand, are common. A typical specimen from the Elbe valley in the Klemm
    collection is thus described by Jähns.<a id="FNanchor_989" href="#Footnote_989" class="fnanchor">[989]</a> The whole weapon is 23·25
    centimètres long, the blade being 18·5, with a maximum breadth of
    1·625. The shape is conical, tapering to the point; a high and rounded
    mid-rib is subtended on either side by a deepened line which runs to
    the end. Between shoulders and blade the front view shows on either
    side a crescent-shaped notch. The grip is narrower at the middle, where
    there is a long oval slit for making fast the handle; and there are
    two rivet holes on either side of the shoulders, whence the mid-rib
    springs. It shows no pommel, the place being taken by a shallow crutch.</p>

  <p>Iron Swords are rare: even in the second century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, when
    the Romans had given up the softer metal, the Gauls and Germans
    preserved it. This is especially noticed when Germanicus marched
    against Arminius, <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 15;<a id="FNanchor_990" href="#Footnote_990" class="fnanchor">[990]</a> and as late as the days of
    Tacitus, Germany could not work the raw metal.<a id="FNanchor_991" href="#Footnote_991" class="fnanchor">[991]</a> Remains of iron
    <i>Spathæ</i> have mostly been found in very bad condition; the material
    also is poor and badly made. The Held or champion used two kinds
    of blades; and the mètre-long two-edged German Sword is not to be
    distinguished from that of the Kelts. The Spatha was especially
    affected by three tribes: the Suardones (Sworders?), the Saxones
    (Daggermen)<a id="FNanchor_992" href="#Footnote_992" class="fnanchor">[992]</a> and the Cherusci; in process of time it reached the
    Goths,<a id="FNanchor_993" href="#Footnote_993" class="fnanchor">[993]</a> <span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>and at last <i>wafan</i> (weapon) applied only to the Sword.
    The blade (<i>blat</i>, <i>blan</i>, in Mid. Germ. <i>valz</i>), with its two edges
    (<i>ecke</i>, <i>egge</i>), was often leaf-shaped, as if copied directly from the
    bronze Sword. Others were smaller in the middle than at heft or point,
    for facility of unsheathing. The tang reached the pommel end, and the
    grip or hilt<a id="FNanchor_994" href="#Footnote_994" class="fnanchor">[994]</a> was lined with wood (birch or beech), bone, and other
    material, covered with leather, fishskin, and cloth. There was no
    cross-bar, but the crescent extending over the shoulders, and serving
    to contain the rivets, was sometimes supplied with a guard-plate (<i>die
    Leiste</i>).<a id="FNanchor_995" href="#Footnote_995" class="fnanchor">[995]</a> The weapon had a solid scabbard, often of iron, even
    when the blade was bronze, and was hung by riems or leathern straps to
    the warrior’s left.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The other German blade was single-edged and curved: it was a
    semi-Spatha, half the size of the Spatha, and it hung to the warrior’s
    right side. This weapon was probably the Sahs,<a id="FNanchor_996" href="#Footnote_996" class="fnanchor">[996]</a> Seax, Sax, the
    favourite of the Saxons; also called Breitsachs and Knief (knife), and
    at later times, <i>scramasaxus</i>, Scramasax.<a id="FNanchor_997" href="#Footnote_997" class="fnanchor">[997]</a> A large iron knife, with
    a yataghan curve, it was used <span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>either as a dirk or a missile. Some of
    these throw-Swords had a hook by way of pommel for better securing
    the hilt. The Schwertstab (Sword-staff) or Prachtaxt is described and
    figured by Jähns<a id="FNanchor_998" href="#Footnote_998" class="fnanchor">[998]</a> as a kind of <i>dolch</i><a id="FNanchor_999" href="#Footnote_999" class="fnanchor">[999]</a> or dagger, attached
    to a long hollow metal haft, like that of a Persian war-axe. It is a
    rare article, and its rarity leads him to believe it was symbolic of
    the Saxnot (Sword-god) Zio, Tui, or Tuisco. Dr. Evans<a id="FNanchor_1000" href="#Footnote_1000" class="fnanchor">[1000]</a> considers
    the weapon ‘a kind of halberd or battle-axe;’ others, a commander’s
    staff or <i>bâton</i> of honour; but the article is too widely used to be so
    explained. A fine specimen of the Schwertstab with handle and blade of
    bronze, was found at Årup in Scania, and an analogous form is shown in
    a Chinese blade.</p>

  <p>History, even written by their enemies, shows that the Ancient Germans
    were an eminently military and martial people. The bridal present
    consisted of a caparisoned horse, a shield, a spear, and a Sword. At
    their festivals, youths danced naked before the Sword-god, amidst
    drawn blades and couched spears. Their lives were spent in hunting and
    warfare. Despite their barbarism, a thorough topographical knowledge of
    their bogs and bushes, mountains and forests, enabled them to inflict
    more than one crushing defeat upon the civilised Romans.</p>

  <p>The highly-developed Teutonic brain also invented a form of attack
    which suited them thoroughly. It was theirs, as the Phalanx, borrowed
    from the Egyptians, became Greek, and its legitimate outcome, the
    Legion, was Roman; and, subsequently, the Crescent, adopted by
    the Kafirs, was Moslem. ‘Acies,’ says Tacitus,<a id="FNanchor_1001" href="#Footnote_1001" class="fnanchor">[1001]</a> ‘per cuneos
    componitur.’ The Keil or Wedge was not unknown to the Greeks and
    Romans;<a id="FNanchor_1002" href="#Footnote_1002" class="fnanchor">[1002]</a> but they used it subordinately, whilst with the Germans
    the ‘Schweinskopf,’ the ‘Svinfylking’ of the Scandinavians, was
    national: they attributed its invention to Odin, the country god. The
    apex was composed of a single file,<a id="FNanchor_1003" href="#Footnote_1003" class="fnanchor">[1003]</a> and the numbers doubled in
    each line to the base; while families and tribesmen, ranged side by
    side, added moral cohesion to the tactical formation.<a id="FNanchor_1004" href="#Footnote_1004" class="fnanchor">[1004]</a> It lasted
    a thousand years; and it played a conspicuous part in the Battle of
    Hastings, where the Normans attacked in wedge, and finally at Swiss
    Sempach. During its long life it underwent sundry modifications,
    especially the furnishing of the flanks with skirmishers; evidently
    the Wedge was admirable for the general advance against line or even
    column; but it was equally ill-calculated for a retreat.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span></p>

  <p>Most writers now consider the Cimbri a Keltic people, and possibly
    congeners of the Cymry or Welsh. Yet in the second century
    <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> we find them uniting, as Pliny tells us,<a id="FNanchor_1005" href="#Footnote_1005" class="fnanchor">[1005]</a> with the
    German Teutones or Teutoni (Thiudiskô, Teutsh, Deutsch). The ‘Kimpers’
    of Italian Recoaro, the supposed descendants of the invaders who
    escaped the Sword of Marius (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 102), undoubtedly spoke
    German.</p>

  <p>Plutarch<a id="FNanchor_1006" href="#Footnote_1006" class="fnanchor">[1006]</a> describes the Cimbrian Sword as a large heavy
    knife-blade (<span lang="grc">μεγάλαις ἐχρώντο καὶ βαρείαις μαχαίραις</span>), They had also
    battle-axes, and sharp, bright <i>degans</i> or daggers: the latter were
    highly prized, and their cuneiform shape caused them to be considered
    symbols of the deity,<a id="FNanchor_1007" href="#Footnote_1007" class="fnanchor">[1007]</a> As usual amongst barbarians, the weapons
    of the chiefs had terrible names, so as to strike even the hearer with
    fear.<a id="FNanchor_1008" href="#Footnote_1008" class="fnanchor">[1008]</a> Their defensive weapons were iron helmets, mail coats, and
    white glittering shields. Eccart holds that these arms and armour must
    have been taken from the foe: their barrows, in Holstein and elsewhere,
    having produced only stone-celts and spear-heads with a few copper
    Sword-blades, but no iron.</p>

  <p>The Scandinavian Goths (Getæ) and Vandals were held by the ancients
    to have been originally one and the same people.<a id="FNanchor_1009" href="#Footnote_1009" class="fnanchor">[1009]</a> Their Bronze
    Age is supposed to have begun about <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 1000, and to have
    ended in Sweden at the opening of the Christian era. They used short
    Sword-blades, which made them, unlike the Kelts, formidable in close
    combat, and the Goths claimed to have introduced the spear<a id="FNanchor_1010" href="#Footnote_1010" class="fnanchor">[1010]</a> to
    cavalrymen. Identical weapons were used by the Lemovii of Pomerania and
    their kinsmen the Rugii. The latter lived on the southern shores of the
    Baltic about Rugenwald, and this place, one of the focuses of the Stone
    Age,<a id="FNanchor_1011" href="#Footnote_1011" class="fnanchor">[1011]</a> preserves, like the Isle of Rugen, the old barbaric name.
    The Danes mostly affected the long-handed <i lang="la">securis Danica</i> (<i>hasche
    Danoise</i>). The Fenni (Finns) of Tacitus had neither Swords nor iron:
    they used only bows and stone-tipped arrows.<a id="FNanchor_1012" href="#Footnote_1012" class="fnanchor">[1012]</a> The bronze Sword
    from Finland ‘with flanged hilt-plate and eight rivet-holes,’<a id="FNanchor_1013" href="#Footnote_1013" class="fnanchor">[1013]</a>

  <div class="sidenote"><i>THE OLD BRITISH SWORD.</i></div>

  <p>We now proceed to the Keltic population of the ‘Home Islands of Great
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>Britain,’ and find there evident offshoots of the Gauls. We have
    no metal remains of the pre-Keltic ‘aborigines’ (Iberians? Basques?
    Finns?) except their palæoliths; and the history of our finds commences
    with the two distinct Keltic immigrations advocated by Professor Rhys,
    the Goidels (Gauls) who named Calyddon or Caledonia (<i>Gael doine</i> or
    <i>Gael dun</i> = forest district) and the Brythons.</p>

  <p>The authentic annals of England, says Mr. Elton<a id="FNanchor_1015" href="#Footnote_1015" class="fnanchor">[1015]</a> begin with
    the days of Alexander the Great, that is, in the fourth century
    <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>; the next historical station being the invasion of the
    Anglo-Saxons<a id="FNanchor_1016" href="#Footnote_1016" class="fnanchor">[1016]</a> in the middle of the fifth century <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>
    He does not trace any continuity of race in Kelt or Saxon with the
    palæolithic men of the Quaternary Age, or with the short dark-skinned
    neolithics who succeeded them. The two were followed by a big-boned,
    round-headed, fair-haired family which brought with them a knowledge of
    bronze and with it the Sword.</p>

  <p>Colonel A. Lane-Fox has summarised the four principal theories<a id="FNanchor_1017" href="#Footnote_1017" class="fnanchor">[1017]</a>
    concerning the source of bronze in Great Britain. Dr. Evans<a id="FNanchor_1018" href="#Footnote_1018" class="fnanchor">[1018]</a>
    prudently finds ‘a certain amount of truth embodied in each of those
    opinions’; but he also concludes that No. 4 must commend itself to
    all archæologists. I quite agree with this view, provided that the
    common centre be Egypt, and that Western Asia be held only a line of
    transit. We have full proof of the immense antiquity of bronze in the
    Nile region, whence the art would radiate through the world. But the
    almost identical proportions of the alloy (nine copper to one tin) and
    the persistent forms suggest that a wandering race of metal-workers,
    somewhat like the Gypsies of a later age, are the originators of the
    <i>Stations</i>, the <i>Fonderies</i>, and the <i>Trésors</i>. The first step from
    Egypt would be to Khita-land and Phœnicia; and these ‘Englishmen of
    Antiquity’ would carry the art far and wide. Sir J. Lubbock opines that
    the Phœnicians were acquainted with the mineral fields of Cornwall
    between <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 1500–1200; somewhat niggard measure, for the
    Bronze Age in Switzerland is dated from <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 3000. On the
    other hand, Professor Rhys absolutely denies that there are any traces
    of Phœnician art in England.</p>

  <p>Dr. Evans<a id="FNanchor_1019" href="#Footnote_1019" class="fnanchor">[1019]</a> assumes the total duration of the Bronze Period in
    Britain at between eight and ten centuries. He would divide this sum
    into three several stages,<a id="FNanchor_1020" href="#Footnote_1020" class="fnanchor">[1020]</a> and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>to the last, which produced the
    bronze Sword, he assigns a minimum duration of four hundred to five
    hundred years. This was followed by the Early Iron Age, or later Keltic
    Period. The metal may have been used in southern Britain, peopled long
    before Cæsar’s time by immigrant Belgii, not later than the fourth
    or fifth century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, the approximate date of the earliest
    iron Swords in Gaul.<a id="FNanchor_1021" href="#Footnote_1021" class="fnanchor">[1021]</a> Lastly, by the second or third century
    <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> the exclusive use of bronze for cutting implements had
    practically ceased in Belgic Britain; the Roman historians do not lead
    us to suppose that the weapons, even of the northern Britons, were
    anything but iron.</p>

  <p>It has been suggested that the bronze Swords found in Britain were
    either Roman, or at all events of Roman date. The discussion began
    as early as 1751,<a id="FNanchor_1022" href="#Footnote_1022" class="fnanchor">[1022]</a> on the occasion of some bronze blades, a
    spear-head, and other objects being discovered near Gannat, in the
    Bourbonnais. It opened with greater vigour between the German and
    Scandinavian antiquaries in 1860, and the late Thomas Wright was
    an ardent advocate of the ‘Italian view.’<a id="FNanchor_1023" href="#Footnote_1023" class="fnanchor">[1023]</a> Dr. Evans, who has
    carefully considered the question, concludes:<a id="FNanchor_1024" href="#Footnote_1024" class="fnanchor">[1024]</a> ‘The whole weight
    of the argument is in favour of a pre-Roman origin for these swords in
    western and northern Europe.’ And he notices, apparently with scant
    respect, the three provinces to which the bronze antiques of Europe
    have been assigned. These are the Mediterranean with Græco-Italic
    and Helveto-Gallic subdivisions; the Danubian, including Hungary,
    Scandinavia, Germany, and Britain; and the Uralian, comprising the
    Russian, Siberian, and Finn regions. Finally he quotes the bronze
    socketed sickle, the tanged razor, the two forms of Sword, the shield
    with numerous concentric rings, with sundry other articles specially
    British, to show that Britain was one of the great centres of the
    bronze industry.</p>

  <p>Lead-bronze, well known in ancient Egypt, is found extensively in
    Ireland, where some specimens of ‘Dowris metal’ have as much as 9·11
    parts in 99·32.<a id="FNanchor_1025" href="#Footnote_1025" class="fnanchor">[1025]</a> The Phœnicians would certainly teach the use of
    an article which takes a fine golden lustre. Dr. Evans<a id="FNanchor_1026" href="#Footnote_1026" class="fnanchor">[1026]</a> notes the
    remarkable prevalence of lead in the small (votive) socketed celts
    supplied by Brittany. Professor Pelligot found some of them containing
    28·50 per cent. and even 32·50 per cent. of lead, with only 1·5 per
    cent., or a smaller proportion, of tin. In others, with a large
    percentage of tin there was from eight to sixteen per cent. of lead.
    Some of the bronze ornaments of the opening Iron Period also contain a
    considerable proportion of lead; in the early Roman <i>As</i> and its parts
    the figures are from twenty to thirty per cent. A socketed celt from
    Yorkshire gives, copper 81·15, tin 12·30, and lead 2·63 per <span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>cent. In
    this case, Mr. J. A. Phillips expresses an opinion that ‘the lead is,
    no doubt, an intentional ingredient.’<a id="FNanchor_1027" href="#Footnote_1027" class="fnanchor">[1027]</a></p>

  <p>Apparently the Roman invaders unduly depreciated the ancient Britons.
    Strabo<a id="FNanchor_1028" href="#Footnote_1028" class="fnanchor">[1028]</a> declares them to be cannibals; yet he includes amongst
    their produce gold, silver, iron, and corn. Cæsar<a id="FNanchor_1029" href="#Footnote_1029" class="fnanchor">[1029]</a> makes them use
    the ring money of Egypt, but Dr. Evans<a id="FNanchor_1030" href="#Footnote_1030" class="fnanchor">[1030]</a> has proved that England
    had a gold coinage in the first century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> It is an old
    remark that a people can hardly be savages when they employ the <i>currus
    falcatus</i> or scythe war-car, the <span lang="ga">griom carbad</span> or ‘Carbad
    scarrda’ of the Irish, the Welsh <i lang="wlm">kerbyd</i>, borrowed from the Gallic
    Kelts.<a id="FNanchor_1031" href="#Footnote_1031" class="fnanchor">[1031]</a> Pomponius Mela also assures us that they had cavalry,
    besides <i>bigæ</i> and <i>currus</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1032" href="#Footnote_1032" class="fnanchor">[1032]</a> Their works in glass, ivory, and
    jet, and their incense cups suggest extensive intercourse, commercial
    and social, with the Continent. During the ninety years which separated
    Julius Cæsar and Claudius, the Britons had made progress in letters,
    and had built important towns. The amount of Latin blood introduced
    into England has, perhaps, been undervalued by our writers; but
    the discovery of Roman ruins, which rapidly proceeds and succeeds,
    will draw the attention of the statistician, and that ‘new man, the
    anthropologist,’ to a highly interesting subject.<a id="FNanchor_1033" href="#Footnote_1033" class="fnanchor">[1033]</a></p>

  <p>The bronze Swords of the ancient Britons are of two kinds: the
    leaf-blade and the Rapier, both well cast. The total length of the
    former is about two feet, the extremes being sixteen inches to thirty,
    and in rare cases more. The blades are uniformly rounded, but with the
    part next the edge slightly drawn down so as to form a shallow fluting.
    The breadth appears greatest at the third near the point, and this
    would add to the facility of unsheathing. In almost all cases they
    are strengthened by a rounded mid-rib more or less bold; or they show
    ridges, with and without beading, or parallel lines that run along the
    whole blade or the greater part near the edges. Some combine mid-rib
    and ridges. The shoulders are either <span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>plain, notched, or flanged. In
    rare instances the outer part of the hilt is of bronze: Dr. Evans
    engraves<a id="FNanchor_1034" href="#Footnote_1034" class="fnanchor">[1034]</a> a specimen of this kind. The total length of the weapon
    is twenty-one inches, of which the globular pommel and the grip, made
    for a large hand, occupy five. The hilt has the appearance of being
    cast upon the blade: it seems to have been formed of bronze of the same
    character, and there are no rivets by which the two castings could be
    attached. The shallow crescent, whose hollow faces the mid-rib (fig.
    293), is a characteristic feature, and endures for ages in the northern
    bronzes.</p>

  <div class="figleft col15">
    <a id="f293"><img src="images/i_278_f293.jpg" width="34" height="268" alt="" /></a>
    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 293.—British Sword, Bronze.</span> (Tower.)</div>
  </div>

  <p>The handle of the leaf-blade usually consisted of plates of horn,
    bone, or wood, riveted on either side of the hilt plate. The latter
    differs considerably in form, and in the number and arrangement of
    the rivets, by which the covering material was attached. Some have as
    many as thirteen piercings; they seldom, however, exceed seven. The
    apertures are either round holes or longitudinal slots of greater or
    lesser extent. There is a pronounced swelling in the grip when the tang
    is of full length. At the end it expands, evidently for the purpose of
    receiving a pommel formed by the material of the hilt. This tang end is
    a fish-tail more or less pronounced. One illustrated by Dr. Evans<a id="FNanchor_1035" href="#Footnote_1035" class="fnanchor">[1035]</a>
    has two spirals attached to the base of the hilt, a rare form in
    England, but common in Scandinavia. Another<a id="FNanchor_1036" href="#Footnote_1036" class="fnanchor">[1036]</a> pommel-end has a
    distinct casting, ‘and is very remarkable on account of the two curved
    horns extending from it, which are somewhat trumpet-mouthed, with a
    projecting cone in the centre of each.’ This manilla-end appears to me
    Irish.</p>

  <p>We have seen the rapier in Mycenæ and Etruria.<a id="FNanchor_1037" href="#Footnote_1037" class="fnanchor">[1037]</a> It reappears in
    northern Europe, England, and France, perfectly shaped; and, though
    of rare occurrence in hoards, it seems to belong to the period when
    socketed celts were in use. There is no difficulty in tracing the
    intermediate steps between the leaf-shaped dagger and the rapier. The
    latter measures from twenty to twenty-three and a half, and even thirty
    and a quarter inches, with a breadth of five-eighths inch, widening at
    the base to two and three-eighths to two and nine-sixteenths inches.
    The largest have a strong projecting mid-rib, while their weight is
    diminished by flutings along either side. Another form of blade is more
    like a bayonet, showing a section nearly square; while a third has a
    flat surface where the mid-rib would be, a form not yet obsolete. Few
    are tanged;<a id="FNanchor_1038" href="#Footnote_1038" class="fnanchor">[1038]</a> mostly we find the base or shoulders <span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>of the blade
    provided with drill-holes or with notches, to admit the nails; and in
    some the wings are broadened for this purpose.<a id="FNanchor_1039" href="#Footnote_1039" class="fnanchor">[1039]</a></p>

  <p>During the Late Celtic Period the Britons, like the Gauls, were armed
    with <i lang="la">gladii sine mucrone</i>, which Tacitus<a id="FNanchor_1040" href="#Footnote_1040" class="fnanchor">[1040]</a> calls <i>ingentes</i> and
    <i>enormes</i>, These Spathæ must have grown out of the bronze rapier. A
    monument found in London and preserved at Oxford shows the blade to
    have been between three and four feet long.<a id="FNanchor_1041" href="#Footnote_1041" class="fnanchor">[1041]</a></p>

  <p>All history declares the Ancient Britons to have been of right warlike
    race; and Solinus<a id="FNanchor_1042" href="#Footnote_1042" class="fnanchor">[1042]</a> relates of them a characteristic trait. ‘When a
    woman is delivered of a male child, she places its first food upon the
    father’s Sword, and gently puts it to the little one’s mouth, praying
    to her country gods that its death may be, in like manner, amidst arms.’</p>

  <p>The ancient Irish seem to have been rather savages than barbarians,
    amongst whom the wild non-Celts long prevailed over the Goidels or
    Gaels. Ptolemy calls the former <i>Ivernii</i>, and it has been lately
    suggested<a id="FNanchor_1043" href="#Footnote_1043" class="fnanchor">[1043]</a> that this may have been the racial name throughout the
    British Islands. The same savage element, which is still persistent,
    was noticed by Tasso, when speaking of the Hibernian crusaders:</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">Questi dall’ alte selve irsuti manda</div>
        <div class="i0">La divisa del mondo ultima Irlanda.<a id="FNanchor_1044" href="#Footnote_1044" class="fnanchor">[1044]</a></div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The modern Irish, who in historical falsification certainly rival, if
    they do not excel, the Hindús, claim for their ancestry an exalted
    grade of culture. They found their pretensions upon illuminated
    manuscripts and similar works of high art; but it is far easier to
    account for these triumphs as the exceptional labours of students who
    wandered to the classic regions about the Mediterranean. If ancient
    Ireland ever was anything but savage, where, let us ask, are the ruins
    that show any sign of civilisation? A people of artists does not pig in
    wooden shanties, surrounded by a rude vallum of earth-work.</p>

  <p>Ireland, like modern Central Africa, would receive all her civilised
    weapons from her neighbours. The Picts of Scotland would transmit a
    knowledge of iron-working and of the Sword to the Scotti or Picts of
    the north-east of Hibernia.<a id="FNanchor_1045" href="#Footnote_1045" class="fnanchor">[1045]</a> This is made evident by the names
    of the articles.
    <img class="iglyph-2" src="images/i_279_s1.png" alt="" width="64" height="16" /> or
    <img class="iglyph-2" src="images/i_279_s2.png" alt="" width="48" height="16" />, the Welsh
    <i>kledyv</i>, is simply <i>gladius</i>; and
    <img class="iglyph-0" src="images/i_279_s3.png" alt="" width="35" height="10" /> is ‘tuck’ or a
    clerk’s Sword. So
    <img class="iglyph-2" src="images/i_279_s4.png" alt="" width="32" height="16" />, the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>lance head, derives from the
    Gaulish spear (<i>lanskei</i>) which Diodorus Siculus terms λαγκία, a
    congener of the Greek <span lang="grc">λόγχη</span> and of the low Latin <i>lancea</i> or <i>lanscea</i>,
    meaning either spear (<i>hasta</i>) or Sword.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">We</span> have now assisted at the birth of the Sword in the shape of a bit
    of wood, charred and sharpened. We have seen its several stages of
    youth and growth to bone and stone, to copper and bronze, to iron and
    steel. When it had sufficiently developed itself Egypt gave it a name,
    SFET; and this name, at least fifty centuries old, still clings to it
    and will cling to it. In the hands of the old Nilotes the Sword spread
    culture and civilisation throughout adjoining Africa and Western Asia.
    The Phœnicians carried it wide and side over the world then known to
    man. The Greeks won with it their liberty and developed with it their
    citizenship. Wielded by the Romans, it enthroned the Reign of Law, and
    laid the foundation for the Brotherhood of Mankind. Thus, though it
    soaked earth with the blood of her sons, the Sword has ever been true
    to its mission—the Progress of Society.</p>

  <p>In Part II. we shall see the Sword attain the prime of life, when no
    genius, no work of art was too precious to adorn it; and when, from
    a weapon of offence, it developed exceptional defensive powers. Here
    begins the Romance of the Sword.</p>

  <div class="footnote">
    <a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> Frederick the Great declared that an army moves like a
      serpent, upon its belly. According to Plutarch, the snake was held
      sacred because it glides without limbs, like the stars. Fire, says
      Pliny (<cite>Nat. Hist.</cite> vii. 57, and xiii. 42), was first struck out of
      the stone by Pyrodes, son of Cilix—<i>silex</i>, or flint, the match
      of antiquity; and hence it was called <span lang="grc">πῦρ</span>; and Vincent de Beauvais
      explains: ‘Silex est lapis durus, sic dictus eo quod ex eo ignis
      exiliat.’ It is the Sanskrit <span lang="sa">शिल</span> (<i>shila</i>), a stone, both words
      evidently deriving from a common root, <i>shi</i> or <i>si</i>. The ‘religiosa
      silex’ of Claudian (<cite>Rapt. Proserp.</cite> i. 201) was probably a block of
      stone like those representing Zeus Kasios, the Paphian Venus, not to
      mention the host of stones worshipped in Egyptian and Arab litholatry,
      and the old Palladium of Troy transported to Rome. ‘Prometheus,’ who
      taught man to preserve fire in the ferule, or stalk, of the giant
      fennel, was borrowed by the Hindus and converted into Pramantha.
      ‘Pramantha,’ however, is the upright fire-stick, first made by Twastu,
      the Divine Carpenter, who seems to have been a brother of <span lang="grc">Ἑστία</span>, the
      Hearth; and hence it has been held to be the male symbol. According to
      Plato, <span lang="grc">πῦρ</span> (whence pyrites = sulphuret of iron), <span lang="grc">ὕδωρ</span>, and κύων are
      Phrygian words; and evidently they date from the remotest antiquity.
      <i>Pir</i> (sun-heat) is found even in the Quichua of Peru, and enters into
      the royal name ‘Pirhua.’ The French and Belgian caverns prove that
      striking fire by means of pyrites was known to primitive man.

  <div class="footnote">
    <a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> There are still races which are unable to kindle fire.
      This is asserted of the modern Andamanese by an expert, Mr. H. Man,
      <cite>Journ. Anthrop. Inst.</cite> Feb. 1882, p. 272. The same was the case with
      the quondam aborigines of Tasmania.

      pre-Adamites of Moslem belief. The capital error of Biblical readers in
      our day is to assume all these myths and mysteries as mere historical
      details. Men had a better appreciation of the Hebrew <i>arcana</i> in the
      days of Philo Judæus.

      supper.’ The old Nile-dwellers, like the Carthaginians and the mediæval
      Tartars, were famous for taming and training the wildest animals, the
      cat o’ mountain, leopards, crocodiles, and gazelles. The ‘war-lions of
      the king’ (Ramses II.) are famed in history. They also taught domestic
      cats to retrieve waterfowl, and decoy-ducks to cater for the table.

    <a id="Footnote_11" href="#FNanchor_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> Thus Lucretius (v. 1301) calls the elephant ‘anguimanus.’
      As is well known, there is a quasi-specific difference between the
      Indian and the African animal. The latter is shorter, stouter, and more
      compactly built than the former; the shape of the frontal bones differ,
      the tusks are larger and heavier, and the ears are notably longer. The
      latter trait appears even in old coins. Judging from the illustrated
      papers, I should not hesitate to pronounce the far-famed Jumbo to be an
      Asiatic, and not, as usually held, an African.

    <a id="Footnote_12" href="#FNanchor_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> The word wrongly written ‘Esquimaux,’ which suggests a
      French origin, is derived from the Ojibwa <i>Askimeg</i>, or the Abenakin
      <i>Eskimantsic</i>, meaning ‘eaters of raw flesh.’ Old usage applies it
      to the races of extreme North America, and of the Asiatic shore
      immediately opposite. <i>Innuit</i>, a more modern term, signifies only
      ‘the people,’ like <i>Khoi-khoi</i> (‘men of men’), the Hottentots, and
      like ‘Bantu’ (Folk), applied, or rather misapplied, to the great South
      African race. <i>Innuit</i>, moreover, is by no means universal. The Eskimos
      supply a valuable study; amongst other primæval peculiarities, they
      have little reverence for the dead, and scant attachment to place.

      (i. 28). Colonel Yule quotes Pliny, Ælian, and the Chinese. The
      animal drops its loose quills when running, and when at bay attempts,
      hedgehog-like, to hide and shield its head. It is, as the Gypsies know,
      excellent eating, equal to the most delicate pork; only somewhat dry
      without the aid of lard.

      ‘tiger’s-claws’ of horn; formerly, when these were of steel, the death
      of one of the athletes was unavoidable. The weapons, fitted into a kind
      of handle, were fastened by thongs to the closed right hand. The men,
      drunk with Bhang or Indian hemp, rushed upon each other and tore like
      tigers at face and body; forehead-skins would hang in shreds; necks and
      ribs would be laid open, and not unfrequently one or both would bleed

      for huts; for grubbing up roots, and killing animals for food; for
      preparing firewood; for scraping the flesh from the bones when eating,

      (blow-tube) is, according to Demmin (p. 468), <i>arbotana</i>, or rather
      <i>carpicanna</i>, derived from ‘Carpi,’ the place of manufacture, and the
      Assyrian (<i>Kane</i>), Greek and Latin <span lang="grc">κάννα</span> (<i>canna</i>), whence ‘cannon.’
      This tube, spread over three distinct racial areas in Southern Asia,
      Africa, and America, is used either for propelling clay balls or
      arrowlets, poisoned and unpoisoned. It is the sumpitan of Borneo,
      where Pigafetta (1520) mentions reeds of this kind in Cayayan and
      Palavan Islands. The hollow bamboo is still used by the Laos of Siam,
      and is preserved among the Malagasy as a boyish way of killing birds.
      Père Bourieu notes it among the Malaccan negrito aborigines, whom the
      Moslem Malays call ‘Oran-Banua’ (men of the woods); the weapon they
      term <i>tomeang</i>. It is known in Ceylon, in Silhet, and on both sides
      of the Bay of Bengal. Condamine describes it among the Yameos (South
      American Indians); Waterlow and Klemm, in New Guinea, and Markham
      among the Uapes and other tribes on the Amazonas head-waters. In the
      New World it is of two varieties: the long heavy zarabatana, and the
      thinner, slighter pucuna. Finally, it has degraded to the ‘pea-shooter’
      of modern Europe. The principal feature of the weapon is the poisoned
      dart; it is therefore unknown amongst tribes who, like the Andamanese,
      have not studied toxics (<cite>Journ. Anthrop. Inst.</cite> p. 270, February

      the torsion principle; those of the mediævals were of two types, the
      sling and the crossbow. The ‘tormentum’ was so called because all its
      parts were twisted; the ‘scorpion’ (or catapult), because the bow was
      vertically placed, like the insect’s raised tail; and the ‘onager,’
      because the ‘wild asses, when hunted, throw the stones behind them by
      their kicks, so as to pierce the chests of those who pursue them, or
      to fracture them.’ So at least says A. Marcellinus (<cite>Hist.</cite> xxiii. 4).

      (<cite>Proc. Soc. Ant.</cite> 2nd S. vii. 396) that <i>celte</i> in Job is a misreading
      for <i>certe</i>. He justly reprobates the fashion of writing ‘Kelt,’
      and the newly-coined French plural <i>celtæ</i>. The truth is that not a
      few antiquaries have confounded the instrument with the Keltic or
      Celtic tribes. The word, meaning a stone axe, adze, or chisel, has
      been erroneously derived from the Celts, properly Kelts, and by older
      philologists <i>a cælando</i>, which would convert it into a congener of
      <i>cælum</i>. It is the Latin <i>celtis</i> or <i>celtes</i>, a chisel, possibly a
      relative of the Welsh <i>cellt</i>, a flint. The word is found, according
      to Mr. Evans, only in the Vulgate translation of Job, in Saint Jerome,
      and in a forged inscription. He first met with its antiquarian use in
      Beger’s <cite>Thesaurus Brandenburgicus</cite> (1696), where a metal <i>securis</i>

      attention of the Society of Antiquaries to the Drift (palæolithic)
      instruments occurring at Hoxne, Suffolk, together with remains of the
      elephant and other extinct animals. He was one of several; but, as
      usually happens, the wit of one man collected and systematised the
      scattered experience of many. The man was M. Boucher de Perthes, whose

      Gunpowder, age of weapons. In these ‘ages’ we have a fine instance
      of hasty and indiscriminate generalisation. They originated in
      Scandinavia, where Stone was used almost exclusively from the beginning
      of man’s occupation till <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 2000–1000. At that time the
      Bronze began, and ended with the Iron about the Christian era. Thomsen,
      who classified the Copenhagen Museum in 1836; Nilsson, the Swede, who
      founded comparative anthropology (1838–43); Forchhammer and Worsäae,
      the Dane, who illustrated the Bronze Age (1845), fairly established
      the local sequence. It was accepted by F. Keller, of the Zurich Lake
      (1853), by Count Gozzadini, of Bologna (1854), by Lyell (1863), and by
      Professor Max Müller (1863, 1868, and 1873), who seems to have followed
      the Swiss studies of M. Morlot (<cite>Bulletin de la Soc. Vaudoise</cite>, tome
      vi. etc.) Unhappily, the useful order was applied to the whole world,
      when its deficiency became prominent and palpable. I note that Mr.
      Joseph Anderson (<cite>Scotland in Early Christian Times</cite>, p. 19) retains
      the ‘three stages of progress’—stone, bronze, and iron. Brugsch
      (<cite>History</cite>, i. 25) petulantly rejects them, declaring that Egypt
      ‘throws scorn upon these assumed periods,’ the reverse being the case.
      Mr. John Evans (<cite>The Ancient Stone Implements, &amp;c., of Great Britain</cite>,
      p. 2) adopts the succession-idea, warning us that the classification
      does not imply any exact chronology. He finds Biblical grounds ‘in
      favour of such a view of gradual development of material civilisation.’
      Adam’s personal equipment in the way of tools or weapons would have
      been but insufficient, if no artificer was instructed in brass and iron
      until the days of Tubal Cain, the sixth in descent when a generation
      covered a hundred years. Mr. Evans divides the Stone Age into four
      periods. First, the Palæolithic, River-gravel, or Drift, when only
      chipping was used; second, the Reindeer, or Cavern-epoch of Central
      France, and an intermediate age, when surface-chipping is found; third,
      the Neolithic, or surface stone-period of Western Europe, in which
      grinding was practised; and, lastly, the Metallo-lithic age, which
      attained the highest degree of manual skill.

      Sword; but the Horn Age compels me to show, in a few words, how that
      material, combined with hoofs, gave rise to scale armour. Pausanias,
      confirmed by Tacitus, informs us that the Sarmatians (Slavs) prepared
      the horse-hoofs of their large herds and sewed them with nerves and
      sinews to overlap like the surface of a fir-cone. He adds that this
      lorica was not inferior in strength or in elegance to the metal-work
      of the Greeks. The Emperor Domitian wore a corslet of boars’-hoofs
      stitched together; and a fragment of such horn-armour was found at
      Pompeii. Ammianus Marcellinus describes the Sarmatians and the Quadi as
      protected by loricas of horn-flakes planed, polished, and fastened like
      feathers upon a linen sheet. A defence composed of the hoofs of some
      animal, made to hold together without the aid of an inner jerkin, and
      used in some parts of Asia, is represented in Meyrick (plate iii.). A
      stone figure of old type similarly defended, and bearing an inscription
      in a dialect cognate with Greek, appears in vol. iii. <cite>Journ. Archæol.
      Assoc.</cite> Herodotus (vii. 76) tells us of a people, whose name has
      disappeared, that, in addition to their brazen helmets, they wore the
      ears and horns of an ox in brass. This horn-helmet shows the savage
      practice of defending the head with the skins of beasts and their appendages.

      throw-sticks, hatchets, and knob-kerries. The old Lisáns from Thebes
      are illustrated by Wilkinson (<i>loc. cit.</i> i. 5). The name, however, is
      <em>not</em> ‘lissan,’ and they are <em>not</em> made of acacia, a soft wood that
      readily perishes. Why will writers confound acacia and mimosa?

      Treasurer by handing over to him a white rod, and the Lord Steward of
      the Household by presenting a white staff with the words: ‘Seneschall,
      tenez le bâton de nostre hostiell.’ Holding the staff was equivalent
      to the royal commission, and when not in the presence it was carried
      by a footman bareheaded. On the death of his liege lord the great
      functionary broke the staff over the corpse, and his duties were at an
      end. The Lord Marshall of England was expressly permitted to bear a
      gold truncheon with the royal arms at one end, and on the other his own
      enamelled in black. The king solemnly gave the ‘Marshall’s rod’ into
      the hands of Maude, daughter of the Earl of Pembroke, who made it over
      to her son, Earl Roger.

      habitat from light yellow to dull green and dark brown. The worst I

      which it rested. The old Nile-dwellers, like the classics of Europe and
      the modern Chinese, use the shield for their characteristics, their
      heraldic badges, &amp;c. The same was the case with our formal heraldry,
      which originated about the time of the Crusades, personal symbolism
      being its base. As Mr. Hardwick shows, the horse, raven, and dragon
      were old familiar badges; many of our sheep-marks are identical with
      ‘ordinaries,’ and the tribes of Australia used signs to serve as
      <i>kobongs</i>, or crests. Thus, too, in fortification the shield became
      the crenelle and the battlement, and it served to ‘iron-clad’ the
      war-galleys of the piratical Norsemen.

      Pagaya (not a spear, but a paddle-sword) with the ‘sagaia or assagai.’
      The latter word is of disputed origin, and it is meaningless in the
      tongues of South Africa. Space forbids me to touch its history, except
      superficially. ‘Azagay,’ a lance, or rather javelin, appears in

      the Portuguese of Vasco da Gama’s expedition use the term ‘azagayas’

      of Jízah, still works this material in large quantities; and its
      <i>caillouteurs</i>, or flint-knappers, have produced excellent imitations
      of the so-called prehistoric weapons. I have described the flint finds
      of Egypt in the <cite>Journ. Anthrop. Instit.</cite> (Feb. 1879), and shall
      have something more to say about them. A Mr. R. P. Greg, who writes
      in the same Journal (May 1881) on the ‘Flint Implements of the Nile
      Valley,’ is not aware of the fact that I found worked flints near the
      larger petrified forest (Cairo). Since that time General Pitt-Rivers
      made his grand discovery of ‘Chert Implements in stratified Gravel in
      the Nile Valley’ (<cite>Journ. Anthrop. Inst.</cite> May 1882). In March 1881,
      when visiting the Wady, near Elwat El-Díbán (Hill of Flies) amongst
      the cliffs of Thebes, he came upon palæolithic flints, flakes worked
      with bulbs and facets embedded in the hardened grit, six and a half
      to ten feet below the surface. In the same strata tombs had been cut,
      flat-topped chambers with quadrangular pillars. The fragments of
      pottery enabled Dr. Birch to pronounce these excavations ‘not later
      than the eighteenth dynasty, and perhaps earlier.’ The New Empire in
      question was founded by Amosis (<i>Mah-mes</i>, or Moon-child) <i>circ.</i>
      <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 1700; it included the three great Tothmes, and lasted
      about three hundred years, ending with the heretic Amun-hotep IV.,
      slave of Amun, <i>circ.</i> <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 1400, and Horemhib, the Horus
      of Manetho. The worked flints may evidently date thousands of years
      before that period. This is a discovery of the highest importance, and
      we may expect, with Mr. Campbell, that the ‘works of men’s hands will
      be found abundantly underlying the oldest history in the world, in the
      hard gravel which underlies the mud of the Nile-hollow from Cairo to
      Assouan.’ At any rate, this find disposes of the scientific paradox
      that Art has no infancy in Nile-land. The strange fancy has been made
      popular by the Egyptologist, who threatens to become as troublesome as
      the Sanskritist.

      can be safely bought in Egypt, the substance being too hard for cheap
      imitation work. Dr. Henry Schliemann constantly mentions diorite in
      his <cite>Troy and its Remains</cite> (1875); for instance, ‘wedges’ (i.e. axes)
      large and small, (pp. 21, 28, 154): he speaks of an immense quantity of
      diorite implements (p. 75); of a Priapus of diorite twelve inches high
      (p. 169); of ‘curious little sling bullets’ (p. 236), and of hammers
      (p. 285). At Mycenæ he found ‘two well-polished axes of diorite.’ But
      as he also calls it ‘hard black stone,’ I suspect it to be basalt, as
      his ‘green stone’ (<cite>Troy</cite>, p. 21) may be jade or jadeite.

      historian has explained how this mighty organisation crumbled to pieces
      at the touch of a few European adventurers.

    <p>I have read with interest the able work of M. Vicente F. Lopez, <cite>Les
      Races Aryennes du Pérou</cite> (Paris: Franck, 1871): he derives the word
      from Pirhua, the first Ynka deified to a Creator. He adopts (p. 17)
      against Garcilasso de la Vega, who gave the Ynkarial Empire 400 years,
      the opinions of the learned Dr. Fernando Montésinos el Visitador, of
      the later sixteenth century, who is set aside by Markham, <cite>Narratives
      of the Yncas</cite> (Hakluyt, 1873). Montésinos derives the Peruvians from
      Armenia five centuries after ‘the Flood,’ and assigns 4,000 years
      with 101 emperors to the dynasty; it begins with Manko Kapak, son of
      Pirhua Manko; and Sinchi Roka (No. xcv. of Montésinos) is Garcilasso’s
      official founder (p. 25).</p>

    <p>But I cannot follow M. Lopez in his theories of ‘Aryanism’ (Zend and
      Sanskrit) or ‘Turanianism’ (Chinese and Tartar). The Quichua wants
      the peculiar Hindu cerebrals (which linger in English), and lacks the
      ‘l,’ so common in ‘Indo-European’ speech; ‘Lima,’ for instance, should
      be ‘Rima.’ It has no dual, and no distinction between masculine and
      feminine. But with the licence which M. Lopez allows himself, any
      language might be derived from any other. For instance, <i>chinka</i> from
      <i>sinha</i>, ‘the lion’ (p. 138); <i>hakchikis</i> = <i>hashish</i>, ‘intoxicating
      herb’; <i>kekenti</i>, ‘humming-bird,’ from <i>kvan</i>, ‘to hum’; <i>huahua</i>,
      ‘son,’ from <i>su</i>, ‘to engender,’ <i>sunus</i>, &amp;c., (when in Egypt we have
      <i>su</i>); and <i>mama</i>, ‘mother,’ from <i>mata</i>, μήτηρ, <i>mater</i>, when we have
      <i>mut</i> and <i>mute</i> in Nile-land. For <i>mara</i>, ‘to kill,’ ‘death,’ the old
      Coptic preserves <i>mer</i>, <i>meran</i>, ‘to die’; and for <i>mayu</i>, ‘water,’
      <i>mu</i>.</p>

    <p>I thus prefer the monosyllabic Egyptian for Quichua roots, noting the
      two forms of pronoun, isolated (<i>nyoka</i> = I = <i>anuk</i>) and affixed
      (<i>huahua-í</i>, ‘my son;’ <i>huahua-ki</i>, ‘thy son;’ <i>huahua-u</i>, ‘his son’).
      The heliolatry of the Andes was that of the Nile Valley; <i>Kon</i> is the
      Egyptian <i>Tum</i>, ‘the setting sun.’ The god Papacha wears on his head
      the scarabæus of Ptah, or Creative Might. The pyramids and megalithic
      buildings are also Nilotic. The pottery shows three several styles,
      Egyptian, Etruscan, and Pelasgic. The population was divided into
      the four Egyptian castes (p. 396), priests (<i>mankos</i> and <i>amautas</i>),
      soldiers (<i>aucas</i>, <i>aukas</i>), peasants (<i>uyssus</i>), and shepherds or
      nomads (<i>chakis</i>). According to Cieza de Leon (p. 197) they thought
      more of the building and adorning of their tombs than of their houses;
      their mummies were protected by little idols, and the corpse carried
      the ferryman’s fee. The pyramid of Copan (Yucatan), 122 feet high, with
      its 6-feet steps, is that of Sakkarah. The Yucatan beard in statues
      is Pharaohic. The elephant-trunk ornaments (Stephens, ii. 156) are
      Indo-Chinese. The geese-breeding (ii. 179) is Egyptian. See also the
      Toltec legend of the House of Israel (ii. 172).</p>

      established in London and elsewhere, has the ordinary composition with
      the addition of red or amorphous phosphorus dropped upon the melted
      metal in the crucible. Berthier (<cite>Traité des Essais</cite>, ii. 410) states
      that a very small quantity of phosphorus renders copper extremely
      hard and suitable for cutting instruments. Percy (<cite>Metallurgy</cite>) found
      that copper will take up 11 per cent. of phosphorus; the metal, which
      assumes a grey tint, is quite homogeneous, and so hard that it can
      scarcely be touched by the file. The addition of phosphorus promotes
      the reduction of the oxides, and enables an exceedingly sound and
      durable casting to be made; but if it exceed ½ per cent. the metal
      becomes very brittle. Dr. Percy has described phosphor-silver,
      phosphor-lead, and phosphor-iron. The phosphorus is, according to some
      authorities, apt to volatilise with time. At present a new form of
      bronze, the antimonial, in proportions of 1–2 per cent., is coming into
      fashion: it is said to be malleable and ductile, and to resist torsion
      in a high degree. Another new bronze is the aluminium, whose price
      has been reduced from 1,000<i>l.</i> to 100<i>l.</i> per ton by Mr. Webster, of
      Hollywood, near Birmingham.

      or <span lang="grc">κόλλησις</span>) is attributed by Herod. (i. 25) to Glaucus of Chios, a
      contemporary of Alyattes. The word <i>kóllesis</i> is variously rendered
      ‘soldering,’ ‘brazing,’ ‘welding,’ and ‘inlaying.’ Kóllesis was used
      to agglutinate metals, and treated with a peculiar alkali (Pliny,
      xxxiii. 24). The ‘gold glue’ (<i>chrysocolla</i>) is usually understood to
      be a hydrosilicate of copper; not to be confounded with the <span lang="grc">χρυσόκολλα</span>
      or borax. The Mycenian goldsmiths soldered with the help of borax
      (borate of soda): Professor Landerer, of Athens, found this salt on
      an old medal from Ægina. It was called in the Middle Ages, Borax
      Venetus, because imported by the Venetians from Persia; and it is the
      Tinkal of modern India. According to Pliny, lead cannot be soldered
      without tin, or tin without lead, and oil invariably must be used.
      Later usage substituted for the latter colophonium and other resins:
      we now solder by means of electricity. The same writer makes Nero
      use chrysocolla-powder (a siliceous carbonate of copper, a kind of
      blue-stone which would turn green by exposure to damp) for strewing the

      tint; it was also made of gold and bronze, and termed <i>chrysochalcos</i>,
      ‘the king of metals.’ <cite>Æs corinthiacum</cite> (Pliny, xxxiv. 3), or
      Corinthian brass, used for mirrors, composed of copper, silver (steel?
      zinc?), and gold, was more valuable than gold. According to Pausanias
      (ii. 3, § 3), this malleable and ductile metal was tempered in the
      Fountain of Pyrene. The vulgar legend, refuted by Pliny, who tells the
      tale (xxxiv. 6), dates it from the days of Mummius (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 146).
      A medal of Corinthian brass was analysed by the Duc de Luynes. Pliny
      (xxxiv. 3) mentions three kinds, <i>candidum</i>, <i>luteum</i>, and <i>hepatizon</i>
      (liver-colour), of equal quantities of metal; this probably resembled
      our own alloys. Beckmann (<i>sub voc.</i> ‘Zinc’ and ‘Tin’) gives a list

      spodos, the residue of the former, which falls on the hearth (<cite>De

      ‘Trojan Stratum,’ 30½ feet below the surface (<cite>Troy</cite>, p. 164). The
      <i>guanin</i> or <i>gianin</i> of the Chiriquis was an aururet (electrum) of
      19·3 per cent. of pure gold, with specific gravity 11·55. The <i>tombac</i>
      or <i>tombag</i> of New Granada, used for statuettes, was also a gold of
      low standard: 63 gold, 24 silver, 9 copper. Usually ‘tombac’ applies

      the socketed adaptation, and, lastly, by the simple flat tool wanting
      rib or flange, wing or socket, and formed of pure copper as well as
      of bronze. Archæologists usually determine the last form to be the
      earliest; but M. de Mortillet judges otherwise from the conditions

      the Greek mentions separately (iv. 62, viii. 67). Strabo (xi. 8)
      connects the Massagetæ (Goths) with the <i>Sacæ</i> (Saxons), and Major Jähn

      “specimens of a substance known by the name of wootz, which is
      considered to be a kind of steel, and is in high esteem among the

      of the former. Colonel Yule and his coadjutor in the <cite>Glossary of

      the Yataghan-bayonet, like the old <i>coupe-choux</i> Sword, did yeoman’s
      service. I can see no improvement upon the old-fashioned triangular
      bayonet, which amongst us has been superseded by the short Enfield
      Sword-bayonet. To the latter I should prefer even the bowie-knife
      bayonet, of which the Washington Arsenal was once full, and which has
      been used even lately in the United States. None but practical soldiers
      realise the fact that the bayonet is meant to be a bayonet, not a
      Sword, nor a dagger, nor a chopper, nor a saw.

    <a id="Footnote_441" href="#FNanchor_441"><span class="label">[441]</span></a> Captain George Chapman, in his <cite>Foil Practice, &amp;c.</cite>,
      a book which will appear in the ‘Bibliography’ (Part III.), rightly
      distinguishes between the triangular small-Sword, used only for
      thrusting, and the bi-convex cut-and-thrust ‘rapier,’ a term applied
      by the Germans to the <i>Schläger</i>, which has no point. In England most
      people use ‘small-Sword’ only in opposition to ‘broadsword’; but,
      as the Art of Fencing may be considered a general foundation for
      swordsmanship, all men-at-arms should understand and preserve the
      difference. The writer, however, observes (Notes, pp. 4, 5), that,
      among the various actions which may conveniently be executed with the
      triangular ‘Biscayan,’ there are many which cannot be so easily managed
      with a flat blade, or with the usual weapon of modern combat, however
      light and handy. Hence ‘fencers among military men should be cautioned
      against <em>indiscriminately</em> attempting with the Sword performances
      usually taught in lessons with the foil.’

    <a id="Footnote_442" href="#FNanchor_442"><span class="label">[442]</span></a> It was also a proper name applied to the Paladin
      Renaud’s Sword. The flamberge of the seventeenth century became a
      rapier-blade, and no longer ‘flamboyant,’ and the difference is in the
      hilt, and especially the guards. The latter were shallower and simpler
      than the rapier form, and were more easily changed from hand to hand,
      as was the practice of early fencers.

      série, No. 1, année 1880) there is an admirable paper on Eastern
      heraldry, ‘Le blason chez les Princes musulmans,’ by E. T. Rogers
      Bey. He proves that a heraldic scutcheon is known to the Arabs as
      <i>rank</i>, plur. <i>runúk</i>, and that the word is the Persian <i>rang</i>, colour,
      from which he would derive our (man of) ‘rank,’ a word hitherto
      unsatisfactorily explained. As regards the tints, ‘azure’ is evidently
      the Persian <i>lájawardi</i>; and ‘gules’ is better derived from <i>gul</i>, a
      rose, than from Fr. <i>gueules</i> (jaw), which is L. Lat. <i>gula</i>, reddened
      skin. These three words suggest that for the origin of heraldry in
      its present form we must go back to Persia. Of the Sword in European

      Carter Blake. I am aware of the difficulty in determining mummy-dates,
      but the fact of mummification shows a certain antiquity whose later
      limit is sharply defined. The mummy of King Mer en Rá (Sixth Dynasty),
      found near the Sakkarah pyramids, had been stripped of its bandages;
      but the marks impressed upon the skin showed that the system was that
      of later years. He can hardly be dated later than <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 3000;
      and, reckoning from that period to <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 700, when mummifying
      ceased, we have a population of embalmed bodies of some 730,000,000 in

      Nor is there much objection to ‘Turanian,’ Turan being the non-Iranian
      regions to the east, Tartary and China. But ‘Semitic,’ which contains
      a myth and a theory, should be changed into ‘Arabian.’ Egypto-Arabic
      attained its purest and highest development in the Peninsula; Hebrew is
      a northern and somewhat barbarous dialect; Syriac is a north-western

      Armenia. Hence the ‘Jewish face,’ with its strongly marked features and
      its wealth of hair and beard, appears everywhere in the sculptures of
      ancient Babylonia and Persia. Hence, too, the superficial observation
      that the Afghans and hill-tribes west of the Indus are Jews because

      (<img class="iglyph-4" src="images/i_155_s12.png" alt="" width="59" height="20" />, <i>Shepsh</i>, or
      <img class="iglyph-4" src="images/i_155_s13.png" alt="" width="46" height="15" />, <i>Khepsh</i>), of the ‘old Genitrix’ of the Typhonian type, <i>Kfa</i>
      or <i>Kefa</i> (force, power, might); the Goddess of the Great Bear and
      the place of birth. Hence the
      <img class="iglyph-4" src="images/i_155_s14.png" alt="" width="45" height="15" /> (<i>Ru</i>) or ‘mouth’ of
      the Sword came to be synonymous with the ‘edge’ of the Sword (Genesis
      xxxiv. 36). In the Denderah zodiac, the central figure, the ‘old
      Genitrix,’ holds the Khopsh-chopper or falchion with the right hand.
      The ‘thigh of Khepsh’ is also the Egyptian rudder-oar. The Great Bear
      Khepsh is one of the earliest measures of the Seasons: the Chinese
      still say that at nightfall the ‘handle of the northern bushel’ (tail
      of Ursa Major) points east in spring, south in summer, west in autumn,
      and north in winter.

      <p>Mr. Gerald Massey’s two fine volumes have secured him, and will secure
      him, much bitter and hostile criticism from the many-headed who are
      lynx-eyed as to details while they overlook the general scheme. His
      object has been to show that religion and literature, science and art,
      originated in Egypt; and here he is undoubtedly right. Relying upon
      the self-evident fact that the language of the hieroglyphs contains
      ‘Semitic’ as well as ‘Aryan’ roots and derivative forms, he traces
      these throughout the languages of the world. Whether we judge his work
      conclusive or not, we cannot but admire and applaud the vast reading
      and research which he has brought to bear upon the most interesting
      subject.</p>

      <p>And in another way Mr. Massey has done good. He has uttered a lively
      and emphatic protest against the Sanskritists and their over-weening
      pretensions. In vol. ii. (p. 56) he shows how shallow is the conclusion
      that Ophir was in India because the produce brought back by Solomon’s
      fleets had, according to Professor Max Müller, Sanskrit or Dravidian
      names. ‘<i>Koph</i>’ the ape is <i>Kapi</i> in Sansk.; but it is pure Egyptian,
      <i>Kapi</i>, whence the Gr. κῆπ-ος or κῆβ-ος. ‘<i>Tukkiyim</i>’ (peacocks)
      resembles the Toki of Tamil and the Togei of Malabar; but the root is
      evidently the Egyptian <i>Tekh</i> or <i>Tekai</i>, a symbolical bird. ‘<i>Shen
      habim</i>’ (teeth of elephant = tusks) may derive from the Sansk. <i>Ibau</i>,
      an elephant, but the latter is originally <i>Ab</i> in Egyptian. These
      erroneous views, coming from an authoritative source, are at once
      accepted, copied into popular books, and find their way round the
      world, to the confusion of true knowledge. They make it our hapless
      fate to learn, unlearn, and relearn. See ‘ape’ in Smith’s <cite>Dict. of
      the Bible</cite>, and, to quote one in dozens, the <cite>Trans. Anthrop. Soc.</cite> p.
      435, May 1882,—‘the name for ape in “Kings” and in Greek authors, both
      adopted from Sanskrit.’</p>

      <p>Mr. Massey unfortunately has not studied Arabic, hence many views which
      will hardly find acceptance. In interpreting the hieroglyphics he has
      wisely preferred the ideographic symbolism and the determinatives
      which, countless ages ago, preceded the phonetic and alphabetic forms.</p>

      length. The Romans adopted it as a military decoration. ‘Your courage

      Truth. Mr. Gerald Massey seems to think that Wilkinson’s ‘<cite>Thmei</cite>’ (II.

  <div class="footnote">
    <a id="Footnote_544" href="#FNanchor_544"><span class="label">[544]</span></a> Sesostris derives from <i>Ses</i>, <i>Setesu</i>, <i>Sestesu</i>, or
      <i>Sestura</i>, i.e. ‘Sethosis, also called Ramses’ (Seti-son?). The Greek
      Sesostris combines, I have said, the lives of Seti and his son Ramses.
      According to Brugsch, he is the ‘Pharaoh of the Oppression,’ and the
      son of the unnamed Princess (Merris? Thermutis?) who ‘found Moses in
      the bull-rushes.’


      <p>The Princess Thermutis, says Josephus, named Moshe (Moses) from <i>mo</i>
      (<i>má</i> = water) and <i>uses</i>, those who are saved out of it (<i>ses</i> = to
      reach land). Possibly it is <i>Mu-su</i> = water-son. Josephus was sorely
      offended by the ‘calumnies’ of Manetho; this Egyptian priest, who wrote
      under Ptolemy Philadelphus about the time of the LXX, declared that the
      Hebrews were a familia of leprous slaves who, when expelled from Egypt,
      were led by a renegade priest called Osarsiph (Osiris-Sapi, god of
      underworld); and that the number was swollen by Palestinian strangers
      driven out by Amenophis. He gives the number of lepers and unclean at
      250,000 (= 50,000 × 5), and the Hyksos, another impure race, number
      also 250,000. The learned classics accepted this view, duly abusing
      the ‘gens sceleratissima’ (Seneca), and the ‘odium generis humani’
      (Tacitus).</p>

      Emessa) or B. Kutaynah, a ‘broad’ or widening of the Orontes, was
      first visited by Dr. Thomson of Bayrut in 1846. I rode about the ‘lake
      of the land of the Amorites’ in 1870; but found no ruins, or rather
      ruins of no importance everywhere. It was not then known to me that
      in <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1200 the geographer Yakut (<cite>Geogr. Dict.</cite> edit.
      Wüstenfeld) had noticed the water in his day as the ‘Bahriyat Kuds’
      (Tarn of Kadesh). Since that time the Palestine Exploration Fund (July
      1881) identified the seat of Atesh or Kadesh with the Tell Nabi Mendeh,
      a Santon’s tomb on the highest part of the hill where the ruins lie.
      The site is on the left bank of the Orontes, four English miles south
      of the ‘broad.’ The city disappears from history after the thirteenth

      hitherto mysterious countermarch, the turning back of the Hebrew
      exodus, at the time when the emigrants were advancing straight
      upon their objective. His strong point is the identification of
      ‘Baal-Zephon,’ about which all the commentators have made such hopeless
      guesses. He explains it by ‘Baal of the North’ (Typhon, Sutekh or
      Khepsh), the ‘Mount Kasion’ of Jupiter Kasios, a name derived from the
      Egyptian Hazian or Hazina.

  <div class="footnote">
    <a id="Footnote_562" href="#FNanchor_562"><span class="label">[562]</span></a> Mr. Heath kindly explained to me the key of his system
      published in the <cite>Journ. Anthrop. Instit.</cite> May 1880. The figures at
      Ibríz having suggested ‘Semitism,’ he separated root-letters from
      formatives and found three Aramæan suffixes, <i>t-na</i>, <i>t-kun</i>, and
      <i>t-hun</i>. These gave an immense probability that he had hit upon the
      <i>t</i>, <i>n</i>, <i>k</i>, and <i>h</i>. Meanwhile Mr. Boscawen (Pal. Expl. Fund,
      July 1881) contends that our ‘knowledge of Hittite is confined to
      four syllabic characters and the ideographs.’ The Rev. Mr. Sayce was
      good enough to explain to me how he had determined eleven values. A
      comparison of inscriptions, with the silver boss of Tarkodemos as a
      <i lang="fr">point de départ</i>, suggested to him that the stirrup-shape
      (<img class="iglyph-6" src="images/i_177_s03.png" alt="" width="27" height="25" />)
      marks the nom. sing. of proper names, and this in the Egyptian
      and Assyrian monuments ends in <i>s</i>. He assumes that adjectives agree
      with their substantives, which they follow by taking the same suffixes.
      He was at first disposed to make the broken <i>k</i>
      (<img class="iglyph-6" src="images/i_177_s04.png" alt="" width="24" height="25" /> or
      <img class="iglyph-6" src="images/i_177_s05.png" alt="" width="25" height="25" />),
      which curiously resembles an old Egyptian sign, signify
      ‘and’ (cop. conjunct.); but the incised inscription found by Mr. Ramsey
      at Bór (old Tyana) proved it the determinative of an individual. The
      goat’s head seems from the bilingual boss to have the phonetic value
      ‘tarku,’ and is interchanged with
      <img class="iglyph-6" src="images/i_177_s06.png" alt="" width="25" height="25" /> (<i>ku</i>),
      <img class="iglyph-6" src="images/i_177_s03.png" alt="" width="27" height="25" /> (<i>s</i>),
      <img class="iglyph-6" src="images/i_177_s08.png" alt="" width="24" height="25" />, and
      <img class="iglyph-6" src="images/i_177_s09.png" alt="" width="45" height="25" />. The two spear-heads with the stirrup
      (<img class="iglyph-6" src="images/i_177_s10.png" alt="" width="72" height="25" />)
      appear to represent a patronymic—<i>Kus</i>. The
      second sign (= <i>ku</i>), which seems to be the first pers. sing. of the
      Aor., can be followed in the same group of characters by
      <img class="iglyph-6" src="images/i_177_s11.png" alt="" width="31" height="25" />;
      whence Mr. Sayce inferred the latter to be an adjectival participial
      affix = <i>u</i>. Similarly
      <img class="iglyph-6" src="images/i_177_s12.png" alt="" width="14" height="25" /> = <i>e</i>, the acc. plur.; thus
      <img class="iglyph-6" src="images/i_177_s13.png" alt="" width="45" height="25" /> = <i>ue</i>. The bilingual boss also shows
      <img class="iglyph-6" src="images/i_177_s14.png" alt="" width="17" height="25" /> or
      <img class="iglyph-6" src="images/i_177_s15.png" alt="" width="53" height="25" /> = <i>mi</i>, the third pers. sing. present tense, and we
      find indifferently
      <img class="iglyph-12" src="images/i_177_s16.png" alt="" width="31" height="50" /> and
      <img class="iglyph-20" src="images/i_177_s17.png" alt="" width="27" height="65" />. The gen. plur. is
      <img class="iglyph-6" src="images/i_177_s18.png" alt="" width="25" height="25" />, but the pronunciation is not determined. The same is the
      case with the sock or low boot
      (<img class="iglyph-6" src="images/i_177_s19.png" alt="" width="46" height="25" />), suggested to be the
      third pers. plur. of the Aorist. Lastly, the ideograph of plurality
      attached to nouns and verbs is

      by Kepheus, king of the Æthiopians, and was his capital before ‘the
      Deluge.’ The same author tells us that Andromeda’s chains were there
      shown, and that the monster’s skeleton (some fish cast ashore upon the
      harbour reef?) was brought to Rome by the Curule Ædile M. Æmil. Scaurus
      the younger, who held office in Syria (ix. 4). The bones were upwards
      of forty feet long, the backbone one foot and a half thick, and the
      ribs higher than those of the Indian elephant (a cachelot?). Ajasson
      declared that the remains should have been sent to those who show in
      their collections the weapon with which Cain slew Abel. Pausanias
      (second century) saw the Lydda streamlet red with blood, where Perseus
      had bathed after killing the ‘Ketos.’ At Joppa St. Jerome was shown the
      traditional rock in which holes had been worn by Andromeda’s fetters.
      The spot is now clean forgotten—at least, all my inquiries failed to
      find it. The testimony is of the highest character; unfortunately it
      testifies to impossibilities—all monsters are ‘contradictory beings.’
      The Ketos, whale or shark (<i>Canis Carcharias</i>), is evidently the same

      1332 began to write philosophical history, assigns to empire in the
      East three generations (= 120 years) and three several steps. The
      first, youth, is of growth (campaigning and annexing); the religion
      being fanaticism and the form of government a limited monarchy of a
      semi-republican type. The second, manhood, is a period of ‘rest and be
      thankful,’ of not ‘stirring up things quiet’; of enjoyment, of easy
      scepticism, of luxury, of despotism, The third, age, is decline and
      fall, the triumph of financiers and capitalists; of aversion from war
      and from ‘territorial aggrandisement’; it is distinguished by employing
      mercenaries, by religious disbelief, by tyrannic rule. (<cite>Ibn Chaldun

      are attacking Bayrút, and the only survivor of the past may be the site
      of Shaykh Ijlin on the coast, south of the Mínat or present roads.
      In noticing Askelon, Mr. Porter tells us all about the old story of
      Ascalonia, Scallion, Shalot: nothing about the Egyptian Ac-qa-li-na.

      and the idea of womanly beauty, was a universal personage. In Egypt
      she was Athor the Goddess of Pleasure, and Ashtar in Nilotic Mendes.
      Amongst the Arabs she became Beltis, Baaltis the feminine of Bel or
      Ba’al, and Alitta (Al-ilat the goddess); among the Sidonians Ashtoreth
      (1 Kings xi. 33); in Phœnicia, Ishtar and Astarte, which Gesenius takes
      to be a Semitisation of the Persian Sitáreh, a star (<i>i.e.</i> Venus); in
      Byblos, Dionæa and Dione; in other parts of Syria, Derceto, Atergatis
      (Ta-ur-t, Thoueris), and Nani, the latter still surviving in the Bibi
      Nani (Lady Venus) of Afghanistan. In Cyprus she was Anat, Tanat, or

      131), Tanata, and Anaitis = Anahid, the planet Venus; and in Carthage,

      continue his exploration of Phrygia; his lecture before the Hellenic
      Society (Dec. 14, 1882) promises much. The western half of the great
      western plateau of Asia Minor, this land of monotonous grandeur, is
      directly connected with the Ægean Sea by a single line of cleavage
      which extends from Miletus to Celænæ. Egyptian art and influence
      found its way to Greece <i>viâ</i> Phrygia as well as through Phœnicia,
      especially in the early days of the Argonauts and the <cite>Iliads</cite>, when
      Greece began to be connected with nearer Asia. Hence the wide diffusion
      of the Midas-myth (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 670): the long-eared king’s tomb was
      discovered in 1800. I have elsewhere noticed how far Phrygia extended
      to the West, leaving indelible marks in Spain and Portugal.

      The Dali inscription is compared with the Lycian at the end of vol. i.
      pt. 1, <cite>Soc. of Bibl. Archæol.</cite> 1872. Discussing the eighty characters,
      the Duc de Luynes found twenty-seven Egyptian, twelve Lycian, and seven
      Phœnician. This would suggest that the syllabary is a branch of the
      picture-writing which grew to be an alphabet proper in the Nile Valley,
      and which, modified by the Phœnicians, passed into Greece. Others
      hold it to be an imperfect modification of the Assyrian cuneiforms,
      introduced about <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 700 and lasting till Alexander’s day.
      I have already noticed that the cuneiforms were originally pictures
      of natural objects; and that the same is evidently the case with the
      Chinese syllabary. Some of the Cypriot signs show a faint resemblance
      to the Devanagari alphabet, which we know to be a modern offshoot from
      South Arabian or Himyaritic. A gold incision from the Curium treasury
      (Plate xxxiv. No. 7) consists of two crescents adossed, which may be
      either Hittite or a simple ornament. Mr. Sayce, indeed, derives the
      syllabary from Khita-land. Of the crescent and the star I have already
      spoken; no date can be assigned to it in decorative art.

    <a id="Footnote_610" href="#FNanchor_610"><span class="label">[610]</span></a> The winged Sphinxes upon this patera with hawks’ heads
      are peculiarly Egyptian. <em>The</em> Sphinx, which may be older than the
      Pyramids, is a man-headed lion—the ‘union of force and intellect.’
      Later types change the human head to that of an asp, a ram, and a hawk;
      and supply the latter with wings. The same is the case with the Sphinx
      of Troy and Assyria: it is mostly alate. The Grecian Sphinx changed
      the bearded human head to that of a woman; the Gyno-Sphinx in Egypt
      being later than the Andro-Sphinx. We find the female in the doorway of
      the Xanthus frieze and over the sarcophagus at Amathus (<cite>Cyprus</cite>, pp.
      264–267). Those who would understand the peculiar beauty, not only of
      line but of expression, which the Egyptians threw into the face of the
      Sphinx have only to study the statue standing to the proper left of the
      main entrance to Shepheard’s Hotel, Cairo. It came, I believe, from the
      great Dromos of the Serapeum, the Apis-tombs of the marvellous Memphis

      of the harm done to philology, in uncritical England, by the one-sided
      and <i lang="la">ad captandum</i> views of the ‘Sanskritists.’ Mr. Gerald Massey
      hardly exaggerates when he says (i. 135), ‘It looks as if the discovery
      of Sanskrit were doomed to be a fatal find for the philologists of
      our generation.’ The peculiar mixture of philology, in its specialist
      form, with the science of religion and the tenebræ of metaphysics has,
      it appears to me, done much harm to all three; but it delighted the
      half-educated public. It met with scant appreciation in acute France
      and in critical Germany, where the editing, or rather mutilation, of
      texts, has been severely chastised. But the Sanskritist, much to the
      discredit of Oriental studies and of philology in England, has given us
      an indigestion of Sanskritism; during the last great Oriental Congress
      in London he almost monopolised time and attention, to the prejudice of
      Orientalism in general. Apparently a protest is on the point of being
      raised; but, unhappily, Teutonism is still a scourge in Great Britain,
      and the typical Solar myth, ‘like Hermann’s a German.’

      old Egyptians faced to the south (Hín or Khount), which they called
      ‘upwards’ or ‘forwards,’ in opposition to the North, which was
      the lower (Khir) or hinder part (Pehu). Thus their right was west
      (Unim) and their left east (Semah): the right leg of Osiris was the
      western side of the Delta. So Pliny (ii. 6) makes his observer front
      southwards. The Assyrian and Semites faced east (Kadam or front,
      opposed to Akhir or Shalam, the sun’s <em>resting</em>-place): hence their
      right (Yemen) was the south, and their left (Sham) was north. They
      introduced this fashion into Ancient India, where, consequently,
      Dakshina (<i lang="la">dextra</i>, the right hand) became the south, and survives in

      applied to Delphi and Paphos, is generally misunderstood. Any traveller
      in India who has seen a Lingait temple would at once explain it, as
      well as the illustration in Wilkinson (vol. i. ch. iv. p. 270) showing
      the Lingam-Yoni, whose worshippers are ‘cherubim’ (i.e. winged Thmei).
      Similarly the symbol of Chemosh of Moab and of sundry classical gods
      was a cone. The Dea Multimamma, Cybele, miscalled ‘Artemis’ (Diana) of
      the Ephesians, was a statue, not a cone, but it stood upon an inverted
      pyramid. The uninitiated as little understand the Crux Ansata or
      Egyptian Cross, the emblem of life and fecundity, which was adopted by
      the Coptic Christians. The sacred Tau (Tau of Ezekiel ix. 6) gave rise

      Naramsin, son of Sargina (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 3750?), ‘which no king had seen

      (Sesostris) left his three ‘columns’ or tablets on the rocks near the
      Nahr el-Kalb of Bayrut (chap. ix.). Six Assyrian inscriptions were also
      known there, bearing the names of Assur-ris-ilîm, Tiglath-pileser,
      Assurnazirpal, Shalmanesar, Sennacherib, and Esarhaddon. No epigraphs
      were found on the north side of the river, where an ancient aqueduct,
      overgrown with luxuriant verdure, turns a mill. About three years ago,
      however, the proprietor, when making a new channel, broke away part of
      the rock, and a fragment bearing cuneiforms attracted the attention of
      Dr. Hartmann, Chancellor of the German Consulate. No other steps were
      taken till October 10, 1881, when M. Julius Loytved, Danish Vice-Consul
      for Bayrut, bared the face of the cliff and discovered five cuneiform
      inscriptions, one containing 45 lines. They seem to have been hastily
      cut, as they follow the shape of the rock whose surface has not been
      dressed. According to Professor Sayce, they are Babylonian, not
      Assyrian.

      especially pyramids (e.g. that at Birs Namrud), an imperfect imitation
      of the Nile Valley. Herodotus attributes to Babylon the discovery of

      the human dorsum to the appearance of the two-humped camel. The late

      (chap. iv. ‘Geographical’). Burnouf (Emile), in <cite>La Science des
      Religions</cite>, made the Svasti the feminine principle; and the Pramantha,
      or perpendicular fire-stick, the male. If used on sacrificial altars
      to produce the holy fire (<i>Agni</i>), the practice was peculiar, and not
      derived from every-day-life: as Pliny knew (xvi. 77), the savage uses
      two, never three, fire-sticks. The Svasti is apparently the simplest
      form of the guilloche. According to Wilkinson (II. chap. ix.), the most
      complicated form of the guilloche covered an Egyptian ceiling upwards
      of a thousand years older than the objects found at Nineveh. The Svasti
      spread far and wide, everywhere assuming some fresh mythological and
      mysterious significance. In the north of Europe it became the Fylfot or
      crutched cross.

      (Assyrian), preceded the Olympic anthropomorphism. Of course they
      were represented with human shapes. Presently the priest introduced

      ancient Egyptians and Persians, the Chinese and Hindús (Marco Polo),
      were truth-telling races who abhorred a lie. ‘How sweet a thing is
      truth!’ exclaimed a Nile-dweller. In the Carpentras Inscription the
      Lady Ta-Bai ‘spoke no falsehoods against any one.’ In the trilingual
      Behistun Inscription (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 516) Darius the king says, ‘Thou
      who mayest be king hereafter, the man who may be a liar, and who may
      be an evil-doer, destroy them with the destruction of the Sword’ (col.
      iv. par. 14). They are now emphatically the reverse. The wild tribes,
      such as the Bedawin, the Iliyát, and the outcasts of India, still
      preserve the old characteristic. ‘The word of a Korager’ is proverbial
      on the West Coast of the Hindu Peninsula. I cannot but attribute the
      deterioration to extensive commerce, contact with strangers, and
      change of faith. The subject, however, is too vast and important
      even to glance at in these pages; but I may note that the Hindú has
      deteriorated even in my day. In 1845 the trade-books of a Sahukár
      (merchant) were received as evidence in our law courts. In 1883 the

      with leaden balls; and was not regarded as a ‘noble weapon.’ The Roman
      gladiators, called ‘Laqueatores,’ derived their name from the lasso:
      they must not be confounded with the ‘Retiarii.’

      signify any missile or weapon; and hence, Dhanúrvidya comprised the
      knowledge of all other arms. The bow was also named; for instance, that
      of Vishnu was called Shárnga (Oppert, p. 77).

      8), ‘If this scale of salaries is correct, and if the salaries were
      really paid, one would be inclined to think that an extensive gold
      currency existed in ancient India.’ That the country worked its gold
      mines is proved by the Wynaad and other diggings, lately reopened, but
      we may fairly doubt the coinage;—at least, till a coin be found.

      Unfortunately the work is unillustrated. Its capital fault is not
      adducing proofs, or offering highly unsatisfactory proofs, of the
      antiquity to be attributed to its authorities, the Shukraniti (p. 43);
      the Naishedha (p. 69), and the various pagodas showing firearms (p.
      76). The Mánavad-harmashástra, or Institutes of Menu (Halhed, p. 53),
      speaks of ‘darts blazing with fire,’ a well-known missile, but not to
      be confounded with firearms proper. And the Institutes in their actual
      form are comparatively modern.

      learned with peculiar intonation (<i>Kirá’at</i>), of which there are some
      seventy systems. The Hindús recite with a similar artful modification.
      So the Hellenes would either pronounce their scriptures, Homer and
      Hesiod, according to popular accent, or intone by quantity. That men
      ever wrote accents without pronouncing them is one of those wild
      theories which can commend itself only to a savant. Besides, we know
      that as late as the eleventh century there were Greek authors who wrote
      indifferently according to accent or quantity.

      this book; its most valuable part, the osteological details of the

      Yet it had the prime advantage of angry abuse by a certain critical
      journal, whose predilection for the commonplace (<i>quâ</i> commonplace) is
      expressed by vituperation of all that is not commonplace. In my case

    <a id="Footnote_822" href="#FNanchor_822"><span class="label">[822]</span></a> Dictionaries derive this word from <span lang="grc">σπάω</span> (to draw). I

      (dim. <span lang="grc">σπάθιον</span>), also Romaic, and verb σπαθάω = I wield (the weapon).
      Spáthe means primarily a broad blade of wood or metal; secondarily a
      weaver’s spatel or spaddle, a spatula (Latin <i>tela</i>); an oar-blade, a
      scraper (for horse-currying), and a broadsword. Scotchmen still apply
      ‘spathe’ to the weaver’s lath (<cite>The Past in the Present</cite>, p. 11), which
      preceded the ‘pecten.’ It is also used for Carnifex in Tertullian (<cite>De
      Cult. Fem.</cite> cap. xiii.), and in botany for a shoot of fructification.
      In Anglo-Saxon it became <i>Spad</i>; Icelandic <i>Spadi</i>, our spade. The
      Latins (Tacit. <cite>Ann.</cite> xii. 35; Veget. <cite>De Re Mil.</cite> ii. 15) converted
      it to <i>spatha</i>; and hence the neo-Latin <i>espée</i> and <i>épée</i>, <i>espada</i>
      and <i>spada</i>, from which we derive our (suit of) ‘spades.’ See the
      play of words upon ‘Metal de Espadas’ in Camoens’ ‘Rejected Stanzas’
      (canto iv. vol. ii. p. 437 of my translation). It has been subjected to
      other corruptions; and in Chaucer (<cite>Knightes T.</cite> 1662) ‘Sparth’ is a

      They consisted of three tribes, each with its capital: the Tolistobogii
      (= Tolosa + Boii) at Pessinus; the Tectosages (of Aquitaine) at Ancyra,
      now Angora, famous for wool and cats; and the Trocmi, with Tavium for

      Olympian Jove stood 60 feet, Apollo 45 (Pausanias), and the Image of

      everything in the Nile Valley. I need not refer to Mount Athos and
      the Charonion of Antioch. The oldest known Greek statue is a portrait
      produced at Miletus in <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 550, and inscribed: ‘I am Chares,
      son of Kleisis, rider of Teichiousa, an offering to Apollo.’ The style

      it with Assyrianism, about the age of Assurnazirpal (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span>

      not even a term to denote the action of riding on horseback’; and
      that ‘even in French a proper verb does not exist, as the expression
      <i lang="fr">chevaucher</i> means rather to stroll (<i>flâner</i>) on horseback.’ As his
      English translator remarks, the assertion is hardly admissible in the
      face of such words as ἱππεύειν (<i>equitare</i>), <i>cavalcare</i>, to ride
      the horse; <span lang="grc">ἱππεία</span> (riding), <span lang="grc">ἱππεὺς</span> and <span lang="grc">ἱππότης</span> (a rider, a knight),
      and <span lang="grc">ἐπιβεβηκώς</span>, mounted (<i>scil.</i> on horseback). His interpretation
      of <i lang="fr">chevaucher</i> is equally erroneous. <i lang="fr">Chevaucher</i>, a fine old word,
      now only too rare, exactly expresses our ‘to ride’: <i lang="fr">Il chevaucha aux
      parties d’occident</i>, is quoted from a French MS. (early fourteenth
      century) by Colonel Yule in his preface to Marco Polo; and the word
      occurs twice in the same sentence with the same sense.

      (viii. 8). Perhaps we may assume an average of 4,000 foot—a full
      Austrian regiment. Each line of the three numbered 10 cohorts, and each
      cohort three maniples. The latter were named from manipulus, a handful
      (of grass, &amp;c., <cite>Georg.</cite> i. 400), because this rustic article at the

      When the Eagle became imperial, and the Vexillum a Labarum with a

      the <i lang="la">comitialis morbus</i> (Afric. War, chap. 14). I have noticed in my
      Commentaries on Camoens (i. 40) the strange fact that some of the
      greatest men of antiquity were subject to this ‘falling sickness.’ The
      Egyptians held it to be a manifestation of the power of Typhon; hence
      the ‘divine disease’ of Apuleius (Defence), and the strange fancies of
      dæmoniac possession which prevailed in the earliest ages, and which
      have not yet died out. The learned Canon Farrar (<cite>Life, &amp;c. of Saint
      Paul</cite>, Appendix, vol. i.) holds that this perhaps was the ‘thorn in
      the flesh’ (2 Cor. xii. 7) alluded to by the great Apostle. He quotes
      from Hausrath the ‘trances’ of Sokrates, the fits of Mohammed, and the
      faintings and ecstasies of Saints Bernard, Francis, and Catherine of

      The Russian had, by the way, curious ideas concerning the use of the

      on his breast, and prod your bayonet there.’ The first rule for the
      General is to be ever looking after his men, to live, as it were, in
      the saddle, and to lead the attack when requisite. What were the habits

    <a id="Footnote_934" href="#FNanchor_934"><span class="label">[934]</span></a> This word has a universal history of its own, and
      contains a lecture on anthropology.

      <p>Its form is onomatopoetic, the earliest form of expression, as the
      Egyptian <i>miao</i>, for a cat; and it admirably conveys the idea of
      muttering or stuttering. Again, it is a reduplication of sounds;
      another absolutely primitive construction, and the effect is emphasis.</p>

      <p>‘Berber-ta’ (Berber-land) was applied by the ancient Egyptians
      (Catalogue of Thut-mes III.), whence our modern term Barbary.</p>

      <p>The word in Hebr. ‘wild beast feeding in waste’ migrated to India,
      and was there corrupted to <span lang="sa">वर्वर</span> (Varvara), a barbarous land, one who
      speaks unintelligibly.</p>

      <p>‘Berber’ passed over to Greece from Egypt, and became <span lang="grc">βάρβαρος</span>, meaning
      a foreigner whose language was not Hellenic, and who, therefore,
      was little better than a beast. (N.B. Shakespeare would have been a
      barbarian in Persia and Hafiz in England.)</p>

      <p>‘Barbaros’ broadened its meaning in Rome, where it was applied to all
      peoples who could not speak or who mispronounced Greek and Latin. See
      Strabo, xiv. 2, on ‘Barbaros’ and to ‘barbarise’; thus unhappy Ovid
      could wail:</p>

      <p>‘Barbarus hic ego sum quia non intelligor illis.’</p>

      <p>Lastly, the ‘proto-Aryan’ term ‘Barbarian’ has now grown to full size,
      and is applied generally to the rude, the fierce, the uncivilised, and
      those who contumaciously ignore the ‘higher culture.’</p>

      ‘life’ is no longer ‘vital power’; it simply represents the sum total
      of the energies and protoplasm. ‘Life is a property of protoplasm or
      bioplasm, and is the latest product of thought and research.’ And I may
      add that Consciousness, like Will, is a property of life in certain of
      its forms; a state and condition of cerebral and other atoms; the mere
      consequence of hitherto unappreciated antecedents.

      when attacking the Capitol, with the Kopis. ‘The first to oppose them
      was Manlius.... Meeting two enemies together, he parried the cut of
      one who raised a Kopis (κοπίδα) by hacking off his right hand with a
      Gladius’ (<span lang="grc">ξίφος</span>). I presume that ‘Kopis’ is here used for the <i>pugio</i>,
      dirk, or shorter sword. Borghesi <cite>Œuvres Complètes</cite>, vol. ii. pp.
      337–387, says: ‘In use and form, in grip and in breadth of blade,
      the Kopis much resembles our <i>Sciabla</i>, (Sabre).’ But its comparison
      with the falx and pruning hook and a medal of Pub. Carisius suggest a
      substantial difference: while the broadsword is edged on the convex
      side, the Kopis had a sharpened concave. Count Gozzadini, like General
      A. Pitt-Rivers, compares the Kopis with the Khanjar or Yataghan, and
      quotes Xenophon (<cite>Cyrop.</cite> ii. 1, 9; vi. 2, 10) to prove that it was
      peculiar to Orientals. I have traced the word to the Egyptian Khopsh or
      Khepsh, and repeat my belief that it is the old Nilotic sickle-blade
      with a flattened curve. But, as might be expected in the case of so old
      a word, the weapon to which it was applied may have greatly varied in

  <div class="footnote">
    <a id="Footnote_995" href="#FNanchor_995"><span class="label">[995]</span></a> Jähns (p. 419) has three kinds of hilts. The oldest is
      the crescent, noticed above (fig. 293); it is adorned with spirals and
      various figures. The second, which seems to be more general in the
      Sahs, or short weapon, has in the place of pommel a crutch or crescent,
      with the horns more or less curved, and either disunited or joined
      by a cross-bar. Here again spirals were disposed upon the planes: we
      shall see them highly developed in the Scandinavian weapons of a later
      date. The third hilt was a kind of tang, continuing the blade, and
      fitted with rounded edges for making fast wood, horn, or bone: it had
      generally a bulge in mid-handle. The pommel proper is little developed
      in these Swords.
  </div>

  <div class="footnote">
    <a id="Footnote_996" href="#FNanchor_996"><span class="label">[996]</span></a> ‘Sahs’ seems to have an alliance with the Latin
      ‘saxum’ (Jähns, p. 8, quoting Grimm). ‘Hamar’ (hammer) had the same
      meaning. From ‘sax’ we may probably derive the Zacco-sword of the
      Emperor Leo (<cite>Chronicle</cite>): ‘Item fratrem nostrum Ligonem cum zaccone
      vulneravit.’ The Laws of the Visigoths mention both weapons, long
      and short: ‘plerosque verò scutis, spatis, scramis’ (battle-axes?)
      ‘.... instructos habuerit.’ ‘Nimith euere saxes’ (take to your
      knife-swords), said Hengist, and the oaths ‘Meiner Six!’ (by my dirk),
      and ‘Dunner-Saxen’ (thunder sword) in Lower Saxony, are not forgotten.
  </div>

  <div class="footnote">
    <a id="Footnote_997" href="#FNanchor_997"><span class="label">[997]</span></a> I have spoken of the Scramasax in chap. v. Demmin (p.
      152) and others deduce ‘scrama’ (broadsword) from ‘scamata,’ the line
      traced on the ground between two Greek combatants(!). Hence, too, he
      would derive ‘scherma’ and ‘escrime’—fencing. Others prefer ‘scaran’
      (to shear), which gave rise to the German ‘schere’ (scissors), and our
      ‘shears’ and ‘shear-steel.’ The word, however, is evidently a congener
      of the Germ. ‘schirmen,’ to protect, defend.

      Jähns (p. 418) observes that the Sahs varied greatly in size.
      Some authorities make it a Mihhili Mezzir (muchel knife), a large
      <i>cultellus</i>. But the Frisian Asega-buch shows it to be a murderous
      weapon, forbidden to be worn in peace. The finds yield at times a dirk,
      and at times a broadsword; such, for instance, are the Copenhagen
      Scramsahs, 90 centimètres long, and that of Fronstetten, which, though
      imperfect, weighed 4·5 lbs. The British Museum contains a fine specimen
      of the Scramasax with engraved Runes.

  <div class="footnote">
    <a id="Footnote_1031" href="#FNanchor_1031"><span class="label">[1031]</span></a> Cæsar (iv. 33): ‘Genus hoc est eis essedis pugnæ;’
      and he speaks again (v. 15) of <i>essedarii</i>. The scythe-car was known
      to Assyria, Jewry (the <cite>Faldat</cite> of Nahum ii. 3), and Persia, where
      Xenophon and Plutarch attribute to it the highest importance; even the
      pole ended in a lance. It became a favourite with all Keltic peoples.
      At Sentinum (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 296) the Gauls almost defeated the Romans
      by suddenly throwing on a force of one thousand ‘esseda currusque.’
      The Tectosages, when engaged with Antiochus Soter in Phrygia
      (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span>), ranged in front of their attack 240 scythe-cars, some
      with two and others with four horses. Antiochus the Great armed his
      chariots not only with two scythe blades, but also with lances ten
      cubits long (?), laterally projecting (Livy, xxxvii. 41). The historian
      also notices the Arab dromedary-riders, ‘archers who carried their
      swords four cubits (= 6 feet) long, that they might be able to reach
      the enemy from so great a height.’ When the Gæsatæ crossed the Alps
      (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 228) they were accompanied by a vast number of war-cars
      (Polybius, ii. 4, 5 says 20,000 ἁρμαμάξας καὶ συνωρίδας) which did
      good service at the battle of Telamon. Ossian’s <cite>Fingal</cite> offers a
      long description of the war-car and its uses. Many remains of these
      two-wheeled vehicles have been found in Keltic Europe (Jähns, pp.
      394–96).

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
